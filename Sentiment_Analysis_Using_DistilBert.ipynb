I didn't even have to replace the batteries in well over a decade of use!HP 12C, I'm coming home!\", 'WHY THIS BELATED REVIEW? I feel very obliged to share my views about this old workhorse, the HP12C GOLD at its 25th anniversary and my 1Oth year as a satisfied ower user and fan. Especially after sharing my frank views on Amazon about two of its three successors on Amazon.com, burying the HP12c Platinum (2004 1st release, HP12cP) and praising the HP12c Platiunum Anniversary Edition (2006 3rd release, HP12cPAE or HP12cPA).To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans, including the non-techkie nerd like myself, the name Hewlett-Packard To the majority of HP 12c calculator owners and fans. The brandname of Hewlett-Packard is synonymous with the highest quality and best range offered in handheld electronic business financial calculators before the first generation of personal computers hits the desktops of business users.To date (December 2007), the bearer of this \"gold\" standard is none other than the HP12C HP\\'s \"golden boy\" in its calculator business segment.The HP12C now a matured product, is the only continuing HP handheld surviving calculator product since \\'81 and probably the longest selling electronic calculator ever. According to HP almost 15 million HP 12Cs, cPs was sold since ,it is probably the best selling HP (and RPN) calculator ever.As a proven product, the HP12C \"gold\" works from day 1, with its form factor and sofware remaining unchanged and has not been dethroned by rivals and even its HP successors which had come and go.Even with PC software versions being sold, the 12C remains the truly indispensable \"portable\" finance-business heldheld computer for its owners, professionals and students alike. This handy companion powers up immediately and is faster than any portable personal computers to jump right into the action.The HP12C is a serious product and the ultimate time tested solution, field tested proven by its users and survived all its rival products, the workhorse moves on.Anyone in charge of this HP line should always bear in mind that the continued production run of the HP 12c is a testimony of HP\\'s quality and standard expected by its customers.Don\\'t just listen to a HP12C fan here, I own and am using three out of 4 models of the HP 12C series, and it is amusing and somewhat disappointing to observe that it had taken HP at least four years and two major upgrades of the HP 12c Platinium, in its futile attempt to \"fix & retire\" the HP12C with three successors in the form of HP12cPlatinum since 2004.It would seems especially frustrating on the part of HP, to realize after all the effort spent on remaking the HP12cPlatinum models that it would not outdone its siblings the HP10bII and HP17bII+ series to seriously challenge the HP12C Gold.  However, by their own rights the HP10Bs and HP17Bs, and the HP12cPlatinum may find their rightful place in the HP financial calculator line, differentiating the HP12C GOLD in terms of price and functions.IMHO, this had happened because the following golden rules were infringed by HP...GOLDEN RULE I - A PRODUCT WHICH STILL SELLS ITSELF IS NEVER OBSOLETE.GOLDEN RULE II - IF IT AREN\\'T BROKEN, DON\\'t FIX IT ! \"The gold rule of thumb should always be guarded as gospel by the HP heldheld calculator product team. Based on the same reasoning, the HP12C\\'s built quality and product standard is paramount to its users.GOLDEN RULE III - ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS! If in doubt, see rules I & II.GOLDEN RULE IV - ONLY OUTSOURCE THE MANUFACTURING OF YOUR PRODUCT TO SOMEONE WHO COULD BETTER YOUR OWN PRODUCT QUALITY. If in doubt ask IBM about Lenovo.GOLDEN RULE V - THE BENCHMARKING INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR THIS PRODUCT LINE IS THE HP12C. Just in case, if HP does not know or is not listening to its customers.GOLDEN RULE VI - DO NOT DISCONTINUE THE ICONIC HP12C GOLD. HP needs no reminder that the customer is always right. Please let your customer, the ultimate market force decide if the HP12C should ever be retired.As an ardent fan of HP12C and line of financial business & scientific calculators, I am of the view that the day when HP discontinue the HP12C would be the day it exit this business segment. I speculate this would happen when the HP brandname disappears from the 12C just like after IBM name had disappeared from ThinkPads and ThinkCentres.Since the price of GOLD is on the rise, it is indeed puzzling to fans of the HP12C, why HP did not release a genuine HP12C gold 25th anniversary model for the fans to mark the occasion, if replacing the discontinuing the HP12C GOLD is the intention READ ALL GOLDEN RULES above.To be fair, the silver HP12c Platinum Anniversary is very nice and has spotted the \"retro\" silver look of the HP 11C, however, it is still not the GOLD standard. With HP missing this golden opportunity to mark the occasion, I would love to see and own a HP 12C engraved with 50th Anniversary logo, reckon that this would be the ultimate testimony for the HP12C and a milestone for its fans.Looking forward, a GOLD 50th anniversary HP12C Anniversary model would be very nice for the fans.For HP, this is a lucrative business proposition. By now, they would have realized that if they have any of its products which could hit a 50th year home run  in 2031, it would not be from its other product line-it would be this original HP12C GOLD standard bearer. So please treat the old workhorse with the upmost respect!', 'I have an HP 48GX that has been kicking for more than twenty years and an HP 11 that is more than 25 years old and still flawless.  I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble (have to press hard for it to register).  No drops, no abuse.  The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic.  The keys feel hollow and light.  The available functions are great.  This is a classic calculator.  But the functions are no good if the keys stop working...', \"I've started doing more finance stuff recently and went looking for a good time-value-of-money calculator. I was pleasantly surprised to find the HP12C was still available. I've been using HP calculators for decades (HP-45, HP-15 and now an HP-32SII) because of their great feel and long-lasting quality. However, it's also true that the HP12C is probably the last relic of the great HP calculator legacy. It has 'Made In China' stamped on the rear, but the keyboard feel seems much like my dear departed 15C. Hopefully it will have the same long-term durability.Why do I recommend this calculator?*) RPN. In my world, the purpose of a calculator is to solve fairly straightforward math exercises quickly. If you're a college student and need speed and pictures and parenthesis, buy a graphing calculator. If you're solving Black-Scholl's option equations, fire up Excel or something on your desktop computer. But for straightforward punch-it-in calculator work, nothing beats RPN entry.*) Fit and Finish. The keys have good tactile feedback. The display blinks on every entry. You just *know* you've entered the data correctly. The purpose of a calculator is quick, accurate answers at your fingertips. If you don't care about this, don't waste money on this calculator (or any high-end TI or Casio). Buy a $5 Walmart calculator.*) Straightforward financial calculations. Sure, I could write a program for my HP 32SII to do financial calculations. But why, when I can just key in the data directly to the HP12C, push dedicated financial keys, and get immediate answers. This calculator has most of the financial functions you need in a calculator (amortization, depreciation, NPV, date functions, etc.) along with the basic complement of standard calculator functions (ln, mean, standard deviation, factorial, etc). The complexity level is about right for a calculator. It doesn't take a computer science degree to operate it like the graphing calculators require, and it's far more capable than the $5 Walmart brands.*) Speed. I see reviews complaining that this calculator is slow when doing things like IRR computations. They're right. So what? If your IRR computation is that complicated, use a spreadsheet. If you're a college student taking exams, you're better off with a graphing calculator anyway. For 99% of the things the rest of us do with a calculator the 12C is more than fast enough, and the price of speed is power consumption. My 32SII is going on 10 years without a battery replacement, and I trust the 12C will have the same thrifty ways. It's a pain to need a quick answer, reach for the calculator, and then find the batteries are exhausted. This was a regular occurence when I owned TI and Casio brands. I've never had this problem with the HPs I've owned.It also has some programming capabilities which some may find useful. Personally, I haven't used the programming mode in a calculator for many years. Almost invariably I find it easier to just pull up a spreadsheet or write some code.I suspect the under-30 crowd will find this calculator--maybe the whole calculator premise--feels 'dated', and in a way they're right. However, if you're one of those who, like me, use these tools every day and always want one nearby, I think you'll like this calculator. For fit, finish, and a pleasant balance of performance with simplicity it seems to be on par with my earlier HP calculators. (Time will tell, I suppose, whether or not it has the same durability.) What is certain is that in the age of cellphones, PDAs and computers the era of high-quality long-lasting purpose-built calculators is going the way of the Dodo bird.\", \"For simple calculations and discounted cash flows, this one is still the best.  I used this in my graduate business program, and for years as a practicing CPA and financial executive.  Of course for complex cash flows you will want to use an Excel spreadsheet; but for quick cash flow calculations the HP12C really is the tool you want.Personally I find Reverse Polish Notation (&#34;RPN&#34;), which is what this calculator uses, to be easy and intuitive.  Many do; some don't.  RPN takes the place of brackets in an arithmetical expression and is easy to learn.The hardware on this calculator is superb.  One of these lasted me decades.  It got lost in an office move, so I am purchasing another.  RJB.\"]\n"

            "[\"These labels are of good quality and just what they should be. They print smoothly without jamming up my printer, they provide good coverage for covering up old addresses or other unwanted info and most importantly they STICK! I hate cheap labels that require you to tape the edges down so they don't peel off.\", \"I love Paper Mate products and almost exclusively use their pens.  I was very excited to hear about the Inkjoy line (the name alone made me smile!).  Unfortunately the 300RT pens have been a major disappointment.  First the good: (1) the colored inks are quite nice and (2) um...that's about it.  The problem is that pens have had serious problems with smudging and leaking.  Almost half of the pens from my 8-pack almost immediately started leaking so severely that it's difficult for the pen to retract.  To use these pens, I have to clean the nib, which is covered in goo, and then I still have issues with smudging (I eventually threw away the offenders).  The pens are also not very attractive, with a totally straight barrel and a rather odd-looking clip.Instead of these pens, I highly recommend the Paper Mate Profiles, which come in the same colors and with which I have never had any problems with leaking or smudging.  The Profiles are also better looking and more comfortable.  From reading through other reviews, I see that not all customers have had issues with pens leaking; however, half of my 300RT pens have leaked, and I never had any of my dozens of Profile pen leak.\", \"These things were a pain.  I tried using the avery design suite... no luck, every time I printed it, it was all over the place.  Tried using the template in word...  a hot mess.  The templates just wouldn't line up.  I print on templates ALL THE TIME. These were the worst I've ever come across.The leftovers.... well... they will be great for the next yardsale, I'll use a pen, and write in the numbers.  Printing nightmare!\", 'The tape is clean looking, prints up nice & stays where you put it. I use it on anything that I want to put the name on. For one spice jars. Files etc.', 'I got this because I hoped it would help with wrapping Christmas presents. I opened the package thinking I would try the ones that attached to your wrist first. After a few minutes of struggling to get the contraption opened, I inserted the tape, but was unable to close it again. I tried on and off for twenty minutes, finally giving up. The one that suctioned to a surface was better, but if the surface had any texture (ie-wood, molded platic) the suction gave out after a tug or two. Overall, the aggravation was not worth it and I decided to stick to the old tape dispensers.', \"Love the lamination! Scotch is the best and they know it cause they charge too much. It's not worth twenty words in a review. If you can find it cheaper somewhere, let me know.\", \"What I love about these is the attached eraser. Some how white board erasers, seem to disappear when you need it the most.  With these, there is no misplacing the eraser. The size is great because it is not the super thick size. However, I'm not sure why Yellow was included. If you have a white board, yellow is invisible. A teacher could write the answers to the exam on the board and not worry that any student will be able to see them whist taking an exam. Great try, but loose the yellow!\", 'Not so much on plastic, glass, ceramic, etc.  Despite reviews here that disparaged the product for those uses, I did try using the BIC Mark-Its on a recycled plastic container, a small Corelle-ware bowl, a glass canning jar, etc., and in each case the results were uneven and anything but permanant.  The markers require a light or white background to be visible; they are not opaque, and so on the glass jar the lighter colors were nearly invisible.  I could see marking a photo that is to be protected in a scrapbook, but the ink rubs, scratches, or scrubs easily off of any smooth surface, and in fact I removed most of an inked circle from a piece of porous unfinished wood, using an ordinary pencil eraser.However, \"permanent\" is also about warning the user that the ink may not wash out of clothes or other places where it isn\\'t wanted, which brings me to the issue of kids using these markers.  I\\'m thinking older kids.  No, they may NOT wash out of that tee or tablecloth (and, by the way, are not recommended by the manufacturer for fabric painting), so you probably don\\'t want them in the hands of your kindergartner.  But for casual adult sketching, or careful use by a youngster who can observe proper surface protection protocol -- because these suckers WILL bleed through thinner paper -- the result will be bright, clear, saturated colors in the lighter shades, and adequate, if not quite so clearly distinguishable in the darkest tones.  Be aware the colors are not as light as the caps indicate, at least not in the pastel range. But the actual colors are actually more vivid, if anything, without going so far as to be \"dayglo brights\".I\\'m thinking those \"adult\" coloring books that often feature stained glass designs or intricate geometric patterns -- I don\\'t think I\\'ve seen a marker at even twice the price that would be likely to give such a pleasing effect for this kind of use.I haven\\'t had them long enough to see how they hold out over time, but don\\'t see a lot of difference between these BICs and the Sharpies for things like labeling school supplies.  If you require opacity, or something that will be permanent on a heavy use item such as cups or dishes, you are simply going to have to spend more and get that specialty product from an art supplier.  So a star off for Bic suggesting uses that won\\'t be entirely satisfactory for this product.  In fact, on Bicmarkit\\'s own website (listed on the packaging), they show projects with results I\\'d say you can\\'t really duplicate at home, in terms of visibility, saturation and precision of the ink on hard and smooth surfaces, based on my own use and the comments of others here.But for paper decoration, or budding sketch artists?

It does take a bit longer than I expected to heat up to the point of being able to use the machine, but it is nothing worth complaining about, especially when you think of the niftiness of this little machine.The sheets that I have laminated have turned out quite well, a little ripple on the very bottom of the finished sheet but nothing that takes away from the finished product.The laminator is extremely easy to use, it is light weight and quite easy to carry around for on the go projects.  I know that this is a machine that will come in handy more often than not.  I do wish the lamination sheets were sold at Wal-Mart, I do not have an office store close by, but will check around for best prices.The laminator did come with a package of sheets to use for the hot setting, I wish it had come with the cool sheets as well, so that I could compare the two settings.Bottom line, I love my laminator and will put it to good use, I do recommend this product for light, quick jobs!I received a complimentary Fellowes Laminator courtesy of the Amazon Vine Program.', \"Samsung SCX-3405FW Wireless Monochrome Printer with Scanner, Copier and FaxThis is a nice little multifunction unit that is quiet.  It installed easily but slowly.  The software installation took quite awhile but it does need to install software for faxing, printing, scanning and copying.On the other hand, the wireless installation went very smoothly.  My E1200n router does not have the easy button that Samsung was looking to find.  However once I opened the router software up, it had a software easy install button and once I pushed it and the button on the printer, Viola!, I had connection.The wireless connection was very fast.  I was also impressed with the high quality of the scan and the copy.  I didn't even test the fax part, it is nice to have if you need it but I have only sent and received two faxes in maybe four or five years.I was not impressed with the screen on the unit.  It is hard to read head on and practically impossible to read from any angle.The software installed without a skip on Win7, Vista and XP.  I test printed from all three OS without a flaw.

I ran a meter on my wireless signal at the signal strength is unchanged.  I tried to connect to the printer using Windows 7, Windows Vista and Windows XP.  None of the systems or OS would connect.  I hooked up the printer via Ethernet and all worked fine.  Sadly with Ethernet I had to reinstall the Samsung software on each computer which was surprisingly labor intensive.  The printing, faxing and scanning aspects of this work just fine but the wireless function has bitten the dust after such a short period of time.  I have downgraded my rating by two stars.Update 10/31/12  The Ethernet aspect of the printer died yesterday.  I could not connect from two different Ethernet switches or from three different OS on three different systems.  It appears that the printer is having cascading failures and I am waiting for the final shoe to drop. It is now connected to a single computer with USB and I will see how long that method of connection continues to work.

This is nothing new, technology wise, except that the usb is integrated into the main canister of the pen, making it easy to transport in pocket or small bag.  It has a sturdy matte finish that's grippy in my hands (especially good for clumsy types), and it's not too chunky to look funny when clipped in a short pocket.My beef with the pen is for the following:1.  Mac compatibility issues.  Try as I might, I could not get the usb fob to sync up with the pointer on any of three different macs including a 2012 Macbook Air, a 2011 Macbook Pro, and a 2014 macbook air.

True, at 30 cents a piece, they cost double, but hey, we didn't have to go anywhere to make them - and doing it as we all sat around visiting was half the fun.On the down side... It takes a long freakin time to warm up, read the memory (especially the first-generation SD cards) and a good, oh,  minute an'a half or so to get the print into your hands.  Was it faster and more convenient and fun than going to WalMart or something?  Sure... but being able to turn it on, have it initialize and read the memory in say, ten seconds, and print each one in say, five, would be much more useful.  I have a hard time concentrating on any one thing for ten solid minutes just to make a couple pictures.Update - 3 weeks later I'm using it for the second time, and guess what?

The best thing about Avery labels that they stick on very well, smoothly, without puckers. I use the lables also with the colored ink jet printer and black and white laser printer. The paper quality is good and there is no blurring of ink when used with ink jet printers. Laser printer results are excellent as well.I usually do need to print a huge number of labels and can't fill the entire sheet. However I found that I can reliably print the labels on the sheet in two several passes, even when some labels were alredy peeled off. o avoid labels sicking to the printer I flip the sheet and have the part that has no peeled labels go first. This really helps me to save money and only print what I need without waste.Avery redesigned the label sheet to reduce wasted paper. Avery has eliminated the paper between the row of the labels.  Despite less of a hold on the labels I am still able to feed the paper through twice as described above.There is a large variety of free templates for use with Avery labels, all you need to know is the number of the label to get the right template.  Using templates I get perfect results with several different word processors - no waste, all labels get printered and perfectly aligned.You can't go wrong with Avery labels.Ali Julia review\", \"This item is being heavily discounted at some online retailers, but make sure you read the fine print before buying: Make sure you can return it for a refund, not just an exchange.It's a fine scanner when it operates -- just read the reviews. But I suspect many people are returning it because, on some systems, software and driver conflicts are causing problems.I tried running it from a Toshiba A10 Satellite laptop with Windows XP and Adobe Photoshop 6.01. It scanned beautifully -- once. After that, the system refused to see the scanner when it was connected. I spent several hours on the phone with Canon customer support trying to resolve it. The rep was very helpful and patient, but ultimately the problem could not be resolved.I went even further, did a several clean system installs on my computer and loaded apps one by one, testing the scanner each time. The same thing happened each time -- one good operation of the scanner, and then the system ignored it.I'm disappointed that what promised to be a very good scanner won't operate due to the mysteries of compatibility. But I'm more disappointed that I can only return it for an exchange. I don't need a duplicate of the problems.I also don't need a $130 boat anchor, which is about all the scanner is right now. I'll probably stick it in a closet and try it with a new system one day, if and when I get one.Again, it seems to be a great scanner if it will run on your system. But before you buy make sure you can return it for a refund. That way if it doesn't work for you you won't get burned.EDITED TO ADD: Many months after I first purchased this scanner and wrote this review I downloaded newly updated driver software from the manufacturer. That apparently finally resolved the issues. The scanner has been working fine ever since.\", \"There really isn't much to say:  assuming you have decent label printing software, these labels label.

The lines on the pages are not too light and not too dark.All in all, if you're looking for a little treat for yourself, try this notebook.\", \"This is the first mouse pad I have ever had to assemble!  The product arrives in a box (frustration-free packaging) with mainly diagrams for instructions.  The mouse pad itself is a rigid platform with a finely-ribbed surface on the top for the mouse to slide over and a smooth bottom section on which you attach the wrist rest.  The instruction diagram makes it look like this product was intended for use by itself or with a similar keyboard pad that is obviously sold separately.  The wrist rest is a soft but firm, gel-like material that is attached to the mouse pad with provided double-sided tape.  Included in the kit are some self-stick feet that allow you to angle the mouse pad platform in whatever direction you might like.Once assembled, the mouse pad is comfortable, and my mouse does seem to glide over it easily and accurately.  I like the rigid platform, and it would be especially useful to anyone trying to use the mousepad on an uneven surface like a couch, your lap, etc.  The wrist rest is comfortable, but it is much like other mouse pads with a wrist rest that I've used in the past.  It is reported to have an anti-microbial covering, although, being a physician, I doubt that this meaningfully reduces the spread of infection since everything else you touch with your hands (think keyboard, mouse, desk, etc.) still harbors germs.  So it is more of a gimmick than anything truly important.  I did not attach the rubber feet since angling of the mouse pad in my particular situation is unnecessary.  I presume they work as intended, though.Overall, this is a nice mouse pad with some unique features in the rigid platform and ability to alter the angle of the mouse pad to accommodate personal preference.  The surface of the mouse pad does seem to improve function of my mouse.  The antimicrobial protection is just a gimmick and not worth spending more money to purchase.  You will have to decide for yourself whether or not this product is worth its $30 cost, but I believe its true value is about a third to one half that price.\", \"Stand as a major brand in this industry, epson did okay on the quality and design of this product.

I have used them to place on the kids gift bags for birthday parties!  So many uses for them!', \"I use these as labels for bottles. It is the perfect size for labeling 12.7 ounce bottles. The positive points are:1 - They do not jam, bend or otherwise get messed up during the printing cycle.2 - They peel easily from the sheet, but stick VERY firmly to glass.3 - They are thick enough so that they can be applied to bottles smoothly with no wrinkles. This is a HUGE advantage over some other types of labels we have tried.4 - The 5264 template is built in to most major software packages. Setting up the labels for printing was a breeze.The negatives are: Haven't found any yet!One reviewer mentioned that he had problems removing labels once they were applied to bottles. First, that's generally a good thing. The last thing I would want to happen is to have the labels just slide off after getting wet or being subjected to temperature changes. However I tried removing labels for the first time last week and didn't really find it all that hard. What I did was rinse the bottles with hot running water for a couple of minutes. I then places the bottles in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes. The labels peeled right off for the most part. In a couple of cases there was a bit of adhesive left on bottles, but that rubbed off easily enough while the bottle was still hot.My wife actually then used a bit of an environmentally friendly degreaser on a bottle that was not boiled, and that seemed to remove the adhesive easily enough as well.I highly recommend this product.\", \"This stapler does everything a home stapler should do.

They're the big name in labels, business cards, etc.  Using the big guy has its advantages, for one thing it's very handy because most programs like Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org already have defaults for most sizes of their products.  I have OpenOffice.org and it found the size easily.  On the back of each sheet, there are instructions telling how to download the Avery Wizard for Microsoft Office.  It also talks about their templates available on their website, however I've never needed to use any; I just use the ones in the word processor.You'll pay a little more for them than the generics, obviously, but it's not much more and it's worth it.  With the cheap ones if you put the label down a little crooked, it sets immediately and you tear apart the envelope and label trying to move it.  These are a little more forgiving and can be adjusted somewhat.  That's a good feature for me.  It's also handy how easy the labels are to tear off.  They don't have the usual paper around the labels.  It's open so you can more easily pull them away from the sheet.The label paper is good quality.  They're for an ink jet printer and the ink didn't run at all when I used them.  The sheets went through the printer smoothly with no issues.  They correspond perfectly with the templates in the word processing programs I use, so printing out a sheet of labels is a simple and painless.I'm quite happy with these and would happily recommend them or Avery business cards (if you're doing cards on the cheap).\", 'I started a business and travel is a hug apart of my life now and this book has made it so easy to keep track of milage and gas costs.', \"I have been using this record book for years!

I hate it in every way.You have to swap out the ink from matte to glossy if you change paper types. It insists you do. There is no way around it (There was on the 2200). This means that every time I print on a DVD, I have to switch the ink. To do so, the printer primes itself and literally takes 7-10% of the ink to do it. Then to switch it back there goes another 7%. I have gone through so much ink I can hardly stand to look at it.Sorry Epson, but the jig is up. This swapping ink system is a scam.Just for kicks, here is the final straw that triggered this review:I had just printed a glossy b&W; print. Then I needed to print a CD so I switched out the photo-black to the matte-black like a little monkey. As the printer primed the inks, it literally ran itself out the last 10% of both magenta and light cyan. Now I can't print. I have to go to the store and buy more colored ink.

Not just are they handy for jotting down to-do lists, important numbers, and must remember dates on the calendar, but for school work as well. This handy reusable six pack offers a great variety of color (red, yellow, green, blue, purple, and black) which is fantastic if you may be color coding certain lists or if just like to write using different colors. The markers are non-toxic and don't seem to have much of an odor. I feel safe letting my children use these to practice writing letters, numbers, and many more things. These are far from the markers I grew up using with odors so strong I'd feel sick and sometimes come down with a headache!Other than the variety of colors and the handy reusable pouch the set of mini markers arrives in that I like is the magnetic caps. The magnetic caps feature not just that but also a extremely handy eraser built into the top! It's been nice not to have to locate a rag or an eraser if I need to make a change to something right away. The erasers remove the dry-erase markings without leaving anything behind on all surface  I tested on. The magnet on the markers isn't the strongest  as I've had a marker take a dive when the fridge door close a little hard. But usually the markers hold well enough to cling to a fridge or on a magnetic dry erase board without issue (I've found these fit perfectly into the top clip some dry erase boards have).  I will state that it's great to not have to also search for a marker if I need to jot something down fast. The magnet allows for ease of use right away, just be careful not to slam a door a little too hard!The ultra-fine tip makes these ideal for use on smaller surfaces (such as a dry erase calender) and gives you greater detail in your writing. The ink flow is strong and the colors bold, in my opinion.  These are mini so if used often enough, a pack might last you a month and half, maybe two.The price is pretty reasonable to stock up on these or purchase them regularly. I would most certainly recommend these for day to day use. If you were writing with these all day long, I don't think they'd last very long.\", 'Bought a Brother HL-2270DW less than 30 days ago.

For 9 folders, I\\'d rather have the plain manilla ones, which are usually sturdier, and use a highlighter or a colored sticker or something, and save the money.', 'I give these labels my highest recommendation as I like to recycle packaging (envelopes, boxes, plastic mailers) and they are sufficiently thick so that you only need one to cover up any addresses, codes, instructions that would ordinarily make it hard to reuse packaging. Even if you tend not to be a person who recycles, these will serve you well in case you need to return a purchase using the same package that it came in.Easy to peel and can be used for addressing using computer software or just as good to peel off and write over them by hand. Priced reasonably and there is little else to say about \"labels.\" If you need them, these are as good as it gets for the reasons highlighted above.If you use labels exclusively for mailings on new envelopes, you might be able to save a few dollars and buy another Avery product that has more labels for a similar price.', 'I used this tape to mask on a particle board, and it help OK. I did have a hard time tearing it, which is a good thing and a bad thing. As usual, there is a trade-off.Overall, I prefer the blue painters tape for most applications: it does not damage the painted surface as this tape would. At the same time, this tape will allow you to mask long and straight lines much faster.I always considered the blue tape to be way expensive, but this tape is 1.5 times more expensive. Hence, in my opinion, the blue tape wins.', \"This product is the printer only.  To print stamps on it, you have to use the Dymo Stamps program.  To use that program, they require you to use labels that they sell for about 9 cents per stamp each.  Generic labels won't work because you need an activation code on the labels.  The generic labels themselves retail for a penny, so you are basically paying them 8 cents per stamp.We use about 12 stamps per week, so the fee is going to be about $4 per month.  If that's worth it, this is the product for you.  If you send more than 25 pieces of mail, you can buy an account for $9.95 per month that lets you use the generic stamps.You can buy stamps online at usps.gov and they will deliver them to your door for free.\", \"We use this tape to mount kids' art work to the refrigerator.

There is nothing partiruclarly speial about them, nothing wrong with them either.  They just are typical writing pens not unlike a Bic pen with a luittle more glitz.', \"August 2012. I purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage. They work - meaning they ring - but I get complaints about voice quality on every call. Cost was $9.00 each with free shipping (assuming the order totaled at least $25.00)Despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted, those statements are simply NOT true. I have two of these phones, both of which are currently wall mounted. As noted in the instructions, you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting. That clip then provides a tab/hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit. This type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that I've ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically. To switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than 5 seconds.Another bit of confusion. A few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one. That is not true, at least in 2012. The cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will.Yet despite that mis-information - I'm VERY disappointed with the voice quality. Every time I answer these phones people complain (unsolicited) about the voice quality. A hard wired phone (as opposed to a cordless) should sound great but clearly these phones don't! Your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a Panasonic, at about $30.00.\", \"The first disappointment with this product came after opening the package. It's nothing more than a cheap and unattractive piece of plastic -- nothing you'd want to hang on your wall. The second major problem is the size. Although it might technically be 8.5 by 11 inches, the interior volume of the sleeve is smaller. Therefore whatever object you place inside it will have to be smaller than a standard-size piece of paper. Due to these flaws the product was useless to me.\", 'This item does not hold  anything ,trying to go down a flight of steps whatever is on it will slide off.I should have purchased bungee cords as well to maybe get this to work bettr.gave this item to my sister', 'Standard yellow legal pads at a good price, perforated for easy tear out.

Challenging the leader is no easy task, but BIC\\'s Mark It, is a similar product line, and their medium point Mark It pens are a pretty good alternative to the very popular medium point Sharpie.The Mark It has a matching colored rubber grip, and is probably available in a wider variety of colors than the Sharpie.  Pricing between the two pens is pretty competitive, and very good deals can be found if you shop around.  If you can make use of the various colors, then these multi-color pen packs could be a good buy.Ink flow is seems about the same, and for ink capacity, the Sharpie might have a slight edge.  Useful life, how long each pen will last before the ink dries up, is more difficult to compare, as Sharpie\\'s can easily last for many years.  As a newer product, it will take some time for the Mark It to achieve the same reputation for quality and reliability that the Sharpie has earned.  Mark It also has a similar line of fine point permanent markers to complete with Sharpie\\'s fine point marker.For many, the choice between the Sharpie and the Mark It, may come down to availability, colors, and price.  A unit price of 65 cents of or less, is a good price.  The Mark It pen is perfectly fine for everyday general use, but if you are looking to get a valuable autograph, you just might want go with the more proven Sharpie.', 'It seems as if I\\'ve used these very good black ink pens by Bic for so long now; I remember writing many a paper for graduate school and Spanish continuing education classes using only pens like these before computers came along. Bic calls these pens \"medium point\" but the writing is clear and very easy to read on the page. The black ink lasts for months--unless you write a lot with these every day in which case they will last a shorter amount of time.The pens are compact and easy to carry with you. The pens are essentially made of plastic with an ink tube inside them; this makes them easy to carry because they are so lightweight. As nerdy as it sounds, gentlemen can easily carry one or two in their shirt pockets. I would make sure the pen was retracted before carrying it in any pocket, however.Actually, I would keep the pen retracted at all times when not using this pen. The ink still inside the pen can dry out rather quickly with the pen open to the air. Moreover, you don\\'t want ink to leak out of the pen and make nasty ink stains.My only disappointment--and this is minor--is that these pens are not refillable. However, this is a minor disappointment; I still like these pens a lot and I use them almost always.Overall, if you want an inexpensive pen that still gives you high quality writing ink, you can\\'t go wrong with these pens by Bic. I have used them for ages with great satisfaction.I highly recommend these pens for anyone wanting an inexpensive but good quality black ink retractable pen.', \"How are these inferior to the similar Avery labels?

You will be lucky if you can receive 100 pages before the tiny black cartridge runs out. Even on Amazon this cartridge will run you $40. That's $0.40 per page. This is on top of the fact that it does not give ANY indication that it is running low on ink. I went to lunch one day and five pages had been faxed, the last two were blank, and there was no indication on the screen.This fax also allows misguided spam calls to ring constantly until it finally realizes that it is junk and makes an even louder beeping noise.

The only difference is that nowadays these do not come with little brushes like they used to back in the day, but foam applicators. This actually helps with applying the fluid more precisely and is an improvement of the original design. I cannot, however, comment on the longevity of the foam applicators - sometimes applicators like these crumble over time. I simply haven't had these long enough to know whether these dissolve over time as well.Compared to the pens I prefer the bottles. The pens dry up quickly and also tend to dispense watery fluid first when using them after a longer period of non-usage, despite shaking them. The bottles work a lot more reliably and quickly than the pens and I would but these again.\", 'Several reviews have noted that the stand arrived with bent or damaged panels. I was fortunate in that, though there were a couple of bent edges & corners, none of the damage was visible in the assembled product, or /prevented/ assembly. You might not be so lucky.

I\\'m not gracile, but even leaning with my whole weight on the stand did not force the casters in. I had to hop up and down. (By the way, the locking casters go in the front.)The quality of the top shelf is, by American standards for cheap particle board, poor. It arrived with a small chip on one edge and a minor crack near one of the cutouts for the support pillar. It developed a second, larger edge chip during assembly.The movable shelf is easy to install or reposition. But why is only one shelf supplied when there are three shelf slots? And why are there no cable holes in the back panel? If a user wants to put a TV on the top and a set-top box underneath, where will the cables go?Cosmetics are a matter of taste, but the square perforations in the side panels suggest a bathroom accessory.It\\'s a perfectly satisfactory printer stand, but (I feel) pricey for its overall quality.

This appears to be a design problem since the fan is in the center of the footrest (between the feet).  However, the heat function worked as indicated though it smelled for the first few hours (coated heating element?). The footrest itself sits high off the ground with very minimal adjustments.

No matter what you will always find yourself using one of these calculators in high school, they are very powerful calculators that have a great advantage over a standard calculator because it has the ability to have programs on it and because it is a graphing calculator. These calculators can even be used during tests such as the SAT! It gives you a better advantage if you know how to use one of these well. The only downside to these calculators is that they require 4 AAA batteries, they last a pretty long time though because the screen doesn't take up much power. Some people might complain that the screen is too low resolution to today's standards or that it isn't a backlit screen,  but this screen is what allows for greater battery use, you wouldn't want your calculator to power off during an exam.

If yo you want greater speed, get theDymo 400 Turbo. They don't print in color, but we don't need color for shipping labels and name tags.I do not recommend you use the printing software that comes with them. It is pretty poor. Also, don't install the drivers that come on the CD. Download the newest ones directly from Dymo's webpage. That will save you a lot of hassles, as some of these seem to ship with outdated, problematic drivers.

But since this is a commercial sharpener, a lot of different people will use it and they are going to see inconsistent results.We placed it in a high school office for a week. It seems silly to say that sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.  But that is true.  Sometimes there was no problem.  Sometimes people pushed too hard and never felt the change in the motor when done, thus eating the pencil down to nothing.Sometimes, the pencils didn't get uniform sharpening all the way around and left wood on one side of the pencil.The feeder (the dial you can turn to adjust the width of the pencil) is not very stable.  It moves easily and it causes the pencil to just miss.One good thing is that the suction feet worked well and the sharpener doesn't move when being used.I tried 5 pencils when I first got it, before I placed it at the school.  The first two ended up as shorties.  The next three were fine.  My wife then tried two more.

I used these clear square sticky tabs that look like a square of very thick scotch tape on a variety of wall surfaces with a variety of paper types from heavy cardboard to thin drawing paper. I left each paper stick to many different surfaces for a full week and the results were all the same in the end-they simply don't work.The tabs stick well to plastic and metal refrigerators- very smooth surfaces, for a couple days. For painted walls, basement cement block and wood, they do not stick at all. After a week of using different papers on a variety of very smooth surfaces, thin drawing paper could not be removed from the tabs without tearing it off. Heavy photo paper did remove, but took off the top thin paper layer on the back. The same for light to heavy weight cardboard- the top layer won't come off, and just stays stuck and tears! Posters could be removed very, very carefully if they were heavy enough- thinner posters or old ones simply tore. I'm glad I didn't test these on anything valuable!Basically, the longer the papers had the tabs on the back, the harder it was to remove without total destruction of the paper! I followed the directions to a tee when removing the paper from the tabs- slowly, by the tab corners, being as careful as I could. After 1 week, the few things that were still hanging, simply tore because the paper would not peel off the tab, kind of like removing scotch tape from thin paper after years! This great idea needs to go back to the drawing board as it's basically good for the smoothest surfaces and the thickest paper for maybe a day or two before the adhesive becomes a permanent part of the paper!

The color swatching for these pens is \"off\", to say the least.  Do not trust the lid to equal the shade of the ink in the pen.  For some colors, it was quite accurate; for others, not at all (and I was tempted to switch some of the lids to better match the colors inside).  If you get these pens, create a test-sheet on pure white paper, so you can have a better color map for the pens.As I tested each color, I found the consistency of the tips of the pens to be lacking.  Some gave me a heavy, thick line, and others a very thin one.  Some ebbed and flowed with the ink distribution.  (With same angles and pressures applied.)  This can be problematic while working on a project.The ink levels/dryness also varied a LOT.  Some pens gave a heavy consistent ink line, while others seemed dry right from the start.  Others gave something in between, as the ink levels came and went.  The lighter colors seemed to be lacking in ink distribution more than the darker, richer colors, but even that wasn\\'t consistent.  Again, if you end up with these, a test-sheet of paper will remind you which colors are heavier in distribution than others.I ran these pens through the wringer, using them heavily to see how they lasted, and again, the life of each pen seemed to differ greatly from the others (but the dryer beginners did die faster, which I expected).

There is NO telltale rough/perforated edge, and the matte ivory looks classier than standard white cards if you\\'re looking for an \"executive\" feel to your cards.I downloaded Avery\\'s own \"DesignPro\" program (free--and idiot-proof), which makes it ridiculously simple to design and print your cards. The best thing about this is that even though the bargain business-card company many of us use (you know which one) does a terrific job for a good price, you don\\'t always need 200 cards and you can\\'t always wait. For instance, if you have a new employee and a conference/tradeshow/meeting in a couple of days, it\\'s easy to knock off a few dozen cards in an instant so he/she can do business right away.Can\\'t recommend these highly enough.', 'I\\'ve been using Avery 5160 return address labels for years, so I was interested in how the \"Easy Peel\" differed from the older ones I still had.  When I took the first sheet out of the box, I was immediately concerned about the weight of the backing; the sheets seemed much flimsier than those I had remaining in my old box, a choice obviously made in the interest of the pop-up edges.  Once I printed a sheet of both and compared the labels themselves, they seemed comparable.  However, a couple of issues emerged:  it was slightly more difficult to manually insert a sheet of the Easy Peel so that the labels lined up correctly because the sheets were more likely to bow, and printed labels stored in a file folder were more likely to catch and come off when pulled in and out.  Despite this, these labels maintain the Avery quality the company has been known for, and they stick well and completely to envelopes.  Note: these labels are for laser printers, not for inkjets.The Easy Peel feature is only marginally better than the old style, which I never found difficult to remove.  Here, you fold the sheet along each row, and a small portion of the labels\\' ends pop up.  It definitely can save time if you\\'re doing a lot of mailing/labeling; however, most people won\\'t care.  I appreciated the feed arrows since I always forget which end should be up when feeding manually.  I printed ten sheets out of the box, in rapid succession, and other than the lining up issue noted above, every sheet came out smoothly and perfectly printed.Although Microsoft Word has the necessary template for these labels in its project gallery, buyers can also get the correct template at the Avery website (address supplied on the box).I\\'ve used several different brands of mailing labels, and I always come back to Avery.  Despite the lighter backing of these labels to enable the \"Easy Peel,\" the labels themselves maintain the same high quality.  I just wish the ease of removal could be combined with a slightly heavier/stiffer backing.  Five stars for the label quality, three stars for the Easy Peel design.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann', 'Having genuine Canon ink has always produced the most predictable results.  I have a profiled monitor for my color work flow.  Output on Kodak Professional Photo paper using ICM profiles (provided by Kodak on their website) along with genuine Canon inks gives me excellent prints on my Canon i950 (yes, it is getting up there in age, but still prints gorgeous prints).And for several years now, I find that Amazon usually has best prices online (unless their competitor has a sale).

At this rate, I\\'ll be shopping every few weeks & lifting the hood to replace them as often.What\\'s worse is that, if magenta, yellow or cyan run low, THE PRINTER WON\\'T ALLOW YOU TO PRINT WITH YOUR FULL BLACK CARTRIDGE. So, I\\'m forced to buy magenta, just to use my full black cartridge. If I ran short on color, my HP would allow me to use black. If I ran short on black, I could use blue.I\\'m also quite turned-off by the misleading name. There is nothing \\'ultra\\' about a tiny cartridge that doesn\\'t even last a month.

The problem with this sharpener is that the mechanism to vacuum the sharpener to a solid surface does not lock in place. As a result, after a bit of use and over the course of time, the sharpener will no longer be in place and will have to be reset.The vacuum does stick in place for a while. But after the sharpener gets used a bit, it dislodged. If the mechanism locked the vacuum in place, this would not happen.It seems to me that the design is faulty. I can't recommend this item.\", 'While the mounting of objects on walls is a great use for double-sided tape, its unintended uses are also very practical.Being able to \"test-fit\" components with this type of tape before final (glued) assembly is particularly handy. Just be aware that the tape can pull off the top surface of any \"layered\" material.You can attach a fairly heavy object anywhere you want on a smooth, strong surface. An open-end wrench from a \"Model-T\" is currently attached to my toolbox fascia, strictly for aesthetic purposes.Most often, I use it for securing small rubber feet/pads at the bottom of items that live on tabletops, as well as securing shims of wood, cork, plastic, cardboard, metal, rubber, etc. onto the bottom of uneven items.If you need to re-attach or re-orient an object that had a single-use, \"peel-off\" sticky surface originally applied, this tape is your friend. The most common usage in that category is the \"deer whistles\" re-attachment on my car\\'s front bumper. I always seem to find them on the ground where I park. Take the time to remove any residual gunk with a Goo-Gone/Dissolve-it -like solvent, and then some alcohol to get rid of any oily film, first.Just appreciate that this tape is permanent in the sense that disassembling the pieces it connects may damage them. You need to \"pry\" things off very slowly and carefully. It is also almost structural at the scale of flimsy plastic components, which seems to describe most objects these days.There is another variant - \"Heavy Duty\" double-sided tape (colored red, rather than white) for more massive items and those that you\\'d prefer to not ever come loose. It works almost like an epoxy. I used some most recently for attaching a rubber/foam door seal (intended for a garage door\\'s bottom edge) as a threshold on a tile floor - 1 year on and it\\'s still holding.Also, don\\'t throw the packaging away, since it lists the strength of the adhesive, which is very convenient when you want to calculate how much to use. 1\" wide tape is also available.This product is an indispensable item in my toolbox/fabrication drawer. I don\\'t use much, but even a small piece is oftentimes invaluable.', \"I've had this printer about six weeks, and, until two days ago, it functioned perfectly.  The printer made high quality photo prints, the duplex function saved paper by printing on both sides of the page, and the quality of text printing was very good.So, why am I less than thrilled?  It's the software.  Although I discarded the HP disk and downloaded the newer software, I've still got problems.  For some strange reason, print jobs can get stuck and refuse to be deleted.  Then I was forced to uninstall and reinstall the software.NOTE:  There is a print diagnostic utility, but it does not cover a wireless setup like mine.If the software worked like it should, this little printer would rate five stars.  As it exists currently, I can only give it a three star rating.\", \"I've got a PaperPro stapler at my desk that I love. It is comfortable in my hand, so easy to close/staple and my boss keeps stealing it and leaving it upright in odd places.  So when I saw this upright PaperPro stapler I thought maybe he would steal that one instead or that I would like this one better since it is smaller and takes up less space.Nope. My boss still steals my other one.  This little blue one works ok but it isn't as easy to close as the bigger one and feels kind of small in my medium-sized female hand.  It also takes full-sized staples but only half a sleeve at a time so if I don't break the staples exactly right I get a mess of smaller bunches.\", \"It's certainly a cool looking stapler. It'll look good sitting on your clean desk, or its bright color will be easy to find on your messy desk.But if your need is greater than stapling 3-4 pages together a couple times a month, look elsewhere.

You get the flat platform, a long piece of double-sided tape to stick the gel pad to the wrist pad portion of the platform and 3 set of \"feet\" that are sticky at one end from which you can change the angle of the platform. These feet stick and \"unstick\" easily (though thankfully, they don\\'t unstick when you want them to stick). It makes it very easy to change the angle to make the platform comfortable to use. Instructions, in the form of pictures, describe how to put together the mouse pad and describes the limited 2-year warranty.The 15% recycled content is a nice feature, but the antimicrobial protection seems to be quite the gimmick. Seems like you just be able to clean it if you\\'re worried about germs. (Note, maybe I missed it, but I didn\\'t see any instructions on how to clean this mouse pad.)Overall, the mouse pad works well. I used it with an optical and non-optical mouse and it worked well with both. I like that I can change the level of the platform and the wrist pad is comfortable. However, the current price of slightly over $30 seems very expensive for this mouse pad.', \"Works well but not up to ecpectations.

The test page displayed clean text and photo reproduction which was, if (not at all unexpectedly) not as good as a photo inkjet, certainly of high quality.Where the problems arose was in the wireless installation.  Initially, during the direct connection phase, local wireless networks were correctly identified and accessed.  It was when the cable was disconnected and the machine operating in full wireless mode that it became evident there was a hardware failure.On all subsequent reinstallation attempts, including two lengthy sessions with the polite and patient technical support reps, the printer failed not only to locate the designated wireless network but any of several other networks in the vicinity which had been previously identified.  I was finally told to take this brand new unit to an authorized service facility.Currently, I have this machine operating as a network printer, directly connected via USB cable to my wireless router.  This is a functional but not especially convenient workaround.Unfortunately, based on my experience, I cannot in good conscience recommend this printer to users looking for the convenience of a wireless color inkjet.\", \"THIS ORDER IS BAD DRY TOO FAST BUT I'M NOT EVEN USE IT YET .

I am a true believer in using labels to help people put items back in the correct place, whether it be in drawers, on hangers, or electronic wires.  The Dymo LabelManager 160 is the low end model of a series, and compared to several previous models I have owned, see picture, it is easier to use has easy-to-access features like bold printing, underlining, bordering, and even landscape versus portrait printing at the touch of a button, and it produces very little waste when printing labels.It is not all peaches and cream, though, for to access special characters, you have to use one of two special character keys, and press it until you get the character you need, then press that key.Operation-wise, it is fairly intuitive, and that is good because there are little to no instructions.  A visit to the Dymo Internet site shows two pdf manuals available: one is tri-fold pamphlet that shows less than the insert supplied with the label maker (I have scanned it and uploaded it as a picture), and the other is a generalize brochure that shows their various label makers, only it does not include the 160 or its predecessor the 150.  Thankfully, it is fairly intuitive.  I did notice that in loading the label in the back, you need to make sure a little of the \"D1\" label is sticking out, say 1/2 inch, or the label will be crunched-up as it is printed the first time you use it.I use several label makers around the house, and while I have several Dymo label makers, I do not use them as much as my P-Touch makers because the glue that holds a label to an item, either when I am labeling plastic drawers or sticking the label back to itself to label a wire, is not as good as that on the P-Touch.  This month, when I saw the chance to test this new model Dymo label maker, I was hoping, since five years had passed since I last used my other Dymo label maker, the glue used on the labels would be stronger.  It was a little, but a simple test of placing the new Dymo label tape along with tapes from a previous model and a P-Touch, showed the Dymo label still comes lose from itself, albeit it is not as much as what the old tape did.  I have posted a picture that shows how much a label comes \\'unstuck\\' from itself after two days.Overall, I would say that Dymo has done a good job in making the LabelManager easy to use.  Unfortunately, when I use a label maker I expect the labels to stay attached for years, not weeks, or months, or even days, when used to label wires.  I have to give it only two stars in this review.  Perhaps, if you want to put some other type of glue on the labels after you print them out, that would probably help, but wouldn\\'t it be better if Dymo made a label tape that stuck to things, including itself, better?', 'I had to buy these to go with the great deal I got on the laminator they go with.

The clear showed air pockets on the bubble containers, and (even after letting the labels dry overnight) when I tried to smooth them out, there was some smudging. Even the slightest bit of moisture smears the labels, which isn't really a good idea for something that is going to hold bubbles.

To set a timer for my 1 hour 15 minute class (e.g. a 3 unit class on a Tues/Thurs schedule), I have to set the timer 5 minutes (exactly) before class actually starts (for 1h 20 min). The timer cannot be preset and paused until ready to begin, which is ridiculous. When time is out, the timer completely resets to 0 rather than hold the setting in memory unless you manually clear.I still like the buzzer, and I deal with the timer daily.

Perfectly sufficient to produce a small run of business cards in a pinch.The matte paper is much better than glossy for business cards.  I compared them by printing on both, and the matte paper helped hide small imperfections of imported graphics, while the glossy clearly exposed them.The sheets are very well produced, and after you break them into cards, the edges are surprisingly smooth.This is a good product that does the job as advertised!\", \"I mail a lot of packages throughout the year, and some brands of mailing tape are absolutely maddening because the end keeps sticking back down on the roll and it takes forever to pry it up again.

However, with just a little soaking, this thing worked wonders, and kept the board pretty dry. I didn't have to use another paper towel to wipe off the liquid.However, it does get pretty nasty after use. It needs to be very thoroughly cleaned, otherwise, just touching it will make your hand dirty.Okay, I have an update now after a month's use:Once you've used water to clean (which worked wonders), the board becomes more difficult to erase. This happens also when I use a white board cleaner, so it might be due to my board. Also, once you've used it with water, even after the eraser has dried, it's not nearly as easy to use anymore. It gets the board dirty with the residue dusts.\", \"While the EF does have more scratch to its flow than the ultra smooth Fine, the extra fine is still a worthy tool to have in the toolkit.Because I wanted to write and draw and have varied line quality, I decided to purchase both and I'm very glad I did.

Actually our expectations were not too high as we bought it mainly for its unique ability to print on CD platters using a special tray into which you place the printable CD (after you have burned your music/data onto it).  It has turned out to be an amazing printer.The software installed quite simply and after snapping in the six (count 'em!) ink cartridges, the printer itself started up nicely and printed a fine test page.  The box included a printable CD, so we tried a rather complicated one with clip art, arched title text, and text in several sizes and colors; and it came out first time looking outstanding!!  We've since experienced similar results printing photos using high gloss photo paper.  Of course it's a little slow, but for the low volume uses for which we bought it, who cares.  The six-color ink is a great feature -- you only have to replace the ones you need and the photos look really great due to the excellent color control.  In short, we're pleased and delighted with our new toy! Recommended!\", \"Well, this is a decent enough file holder.  It holds files, is reasonably sturdy, and the faux leather look is quite attractive.  However, I found that it has some sticking points that I'd consider to be problems.  First off, the company advertising makes a big selling point of how this folder has no flap and how convenient it is and all, and it sounds good at first, but it's actually not a good thing.  You could never take this anywhere without putting a couple giant rubber bands around it to keep it closed because all your stuff will fall out.  Also, it doesn't balance too well on its own, so expect to have to prop it up against something on your desk.  Not being able to stay upright on it's own wouldn't be too much of a problem if it had a flap to keep it closed and your stuff inside it, so you can see how much of a problem this is. Also, the folder is already pre-labelled with months of the year so if you want some other labels you'll have to attach sticky labels to it.  It would've been nice if it had been left blank so the customer could write in their own label, or if it had come with blank sticker labels to fill out.  That would've been a bit more convenient.  So, anyway, it's a decent enough file holder, but the lack of a top flap was a lot more problematic than I'd originally foreseen, so I don't think I'll be using this much.\", \"I use Pilot G2 disposable pens all the time, and I was excited to try out this new casing for them.

Of course, at the end of the day, they\\'re still labels.  They are nice, crisp, and sticky, and worked well with my inkjet printer.  (I have aCanon MP530).  Avery\\'s new improvement is their \"Easy Peel\" technology - there\\'s no label paper in between the columns, so you can bend the paper underneath to get a grip on your finished labels.  I have never noticed problems lifting traditional labels, but if it\\'s a pet peeve of yours, then \"Easy Peel\" is something to look forward to.Where Avery really impressed me was their software.  If you go to their website, they have four free options to generate labels, including mail merges, included graphics, font formatting, etc.:1) The old standard, Microsoft Word mail merges with templates.  This is pretty much the same as I remembered - the 5160 template works perfectly, and I was able to do a test merge using my holiday list.2) An all online solution, \"Avery Design and Print Online.\"  This is the standout for me.  Cool, fully online, capable of using my data files, with clip art and good features.  I like this a lot.  (It was a little finicky with my address file, but with a little editing, I got things running nicely).3) The \"Avery Wizard\" is a downloadable wizard that runs inside office products.  It basically does a mail merge, but simplifies things.4) \"Avery Design Pro\" - I had trouble figuring out this program.  It looks good for cards or envelopes, but for labels this small, it seems like more power than I needed.', 'I purchase these cards frequently to make my own birthday, Christmas and other holiday greetings.

You could buy a note-sized pad of paper for a fraction of the cost.First you have to download the free app Shot Note. Then you take photos of your notes in the app, BUT I wrote about a 10 line note, and it had a hard time processing that much writing. Once you take the photo it goes into shot note. You can import automatically into Evernote or Dropbox by going to the app's settings and giving it your passwords for the other apps. When I opened up the note in Evernote, it was not clear even though I wrote with a ballpoint (something I rarely use). From that point since it is an image, all you have is the record of the note. It did not open on my iPhone. I guess the note had too much information on it for the small screen.Seems like a lot of work and very useless. A better way for me is to scan my notes into Scan to PDF. With Scan to PDF I can also take multiple photos and make into one PDF.  This takes a photo but saves as a PDF. This way I can make comments and use it in more beneficial ways. I can also bring these PDFs into Evernote if I want. I can copy and paste into Evernote too so I can alter the PDF in its Evernote form.

Though it can split at the start, I figured out to how to start it up with negligible splitting.  It also seals boxes really well and meets all postal regulations for performance, which can be important if you ever need to make a damage claim on shipments.  In the past, I've made the mistake of buying cheap, generic office supply store tape.

So far, I have not had any trouble with paper jams, but expect to pay the price when it comes to replacing the drum.  All in all, this is a capable machine that produces high-quality black and white images and text.The printing speed is much faster than that of my old HP, although newer and more expensive models will have increased print speeds.  I like that the paper tray can hold a whole ream of paper without jamming, and that communication between computer and printer seems reasonably efficient.  Printing web pages does not take long, as I did on my HP.  Best of all for me, this printer is Mac OS X compatible with no additional hardware needed; older Macs should also have no trouble.  I have been able to print more than a hundred pages in one session without jamming or other issues.  The print itself is high quality, as one would expect from a laser printer.I do get annoyed with the power saver feature, which I haven't yet figured out how to turn off.  After approximately ten minutes of non-use, the printer turns off, requiring the user to flip the power switch off and then back on.  Rebooting takes approximately 30 seconds.I give this model three stars instead of four primarily because the manual is explicit about eventually requiring drum replacement, a necessity that will cost almost as much as the printer itself.  If you look at this printer as a relatively short term solution to printing high-quality black and white documents, then you will be happy.\", \"I draw and this means that I constantly am sharpening pencils. I'm tired of burned out handhelds and blisters so I decided to go for an electric. I was faced with a  large selection of varying priced sharpeners when I did my search. I decided to go in for a cheaper one. I knew xacto to be good from past experience. So I wound up with this guy.When it arrived I plugged it in and it worked out of the box which is great. Apparently other reviewers had some DOA which is a bummer. As far as sharpening pencils, I can get a stab-worthy point out of pencils with this (I've actually stabbed myself enough to leave a little cut on accident with a pencil sharpened from this). Though if you don't sharpen it as long, you don't have to get the super harsh points. The opening is a bit small so any pencils even slightly larger than a standard pencil are going to be VERY snug fits.This is my only complaint.

This inexpensive 29 inch bar stool would normally have suited my needs perfectly but unfortunately the construction of this one was WAY off. I'm talking about the pre-installed small rectangular wooden box under the seat that you attach the four legs to. The four wooden rails were so far off center that the legs on one side are actually partially outside the saddle. It's offset by about five inches resulting a weird unstable 'diving board' look to the stool with all of the overhang to one side.I can't understand how the makers couldn't have seen what a shoddy job they did before packing it into a box for sale. Of course I fixed it by removing the legs, the rails and re-installing them where they're supposed to go but I had to measure and pre-drill holes which is time and effort I shouldn't have to do.

Been using it for years.\", 'This printer calls for very expensive ink, and the cartridges interact in such a way with the printer that when they register low, they will continue to register low and not work even if you try to re-fill them.  I have tried buying a cheap refillable black cartridge for the printer and filling it with standard black ink and am having trouble getting it to print consistently.  Perhaps it would have been better to use pigment ink which I hear is more compatible with this printer.  Still, the printer recognizes the cartridge as a genuine Epson cartridge and says the ink level is at full and it printed fine for a little while.  When I had initially run out of black ink, the printer would stop every time I tried to print and ask me if I wanted to go ahead and print with all colors.  I would click yes and all would be fine, however there was no way to say \"Do this all the time\", so finally, I clicked the button, \"I have already purchased ink\", to try to make the delay go away, but then I was completely stopped by the printer until I got another cartridge for it.  Maddening!  Also, when I put the cheap replacement cartridge in, I did not fill it up completely as I was not sure it was going to work and I did not want to waste ink, so when I decided it was working okay, and I wanted to take the cartridge out and fill it completely, I almost could not get the cartridge back out.  When I opened the printer, the cartridges would not move into a position where I could open the lid and remove them.  Luckily, I finally noticed settings on the machine that could force this to happen.  After filling up the cheap cartridge completely, it printed fine for a while, but now I can only get it to print when I put special settings on the print job, such as \"photo-paper semi-gloss\", (and the cartridge is quite full of ink - even the printer reads it that way, AND I have tried all the maintenance settings - cleaning the head, etc...).  I have made the \"photo-paper semi-gloss\" settings the default settings and am having mild success printing fairly low quality print-outs (VERY slow print-out, of course). At all turns, this printer is programmed to force the consumer to buy their expensive ink cartridges.  I know most printers seem to be going the same route, but I refuse to give a decent rating to a printer that costs $100.00 and tries to control your every move with re-filling ink or re-placing ink cartridges.  I will probably replace this printer very soon, as I am not sure I can make it print reliably at an affordable price.Update:  It is now April 1, 2012.  I ran out of colored ink and since this printer has no \"use black ink only\" setting, (\"print in grayscale\" setting still uses colored ink.), I am again at a complete stop when it comes to printing.  I have ordered $20.00 worth of compatible ink to refill my refillable cartridges.  (I purchased the refillable cartridges and the ink from Inksupply.com.)  When the ink gets here at the end of the week, I will see if I can make this printer work again.  If not, I will throw it in the trash and go back to HP.  So far, all the HPs we have had, had at least a \\'print in black ink only\\' setting so you could print without colored ink in black and white.  (Although HP seems to be making attempts to get you to ruin your cartridges when you refill the ink by putting many fake holes in the cartridges so you can\\'t figure out where to fill and your ink goes everywhere.  Still, with some savvy, we seem to still be able to make our fairly recent model HP work fine in black ink only.)  All the printer companies are working hard these days trying to sell you $15.00 cartridges when you only need to purchase 20 cents of worth of ink, but I really hate the Epson company and would never try them again.Update: April 6, 2012.  Got the compatible ink - emptied the black cartridge of incompatible ink and filled all cartridges with compatible ink.  I can now get a splotchy black print on \\'plain paper\\', \\'normal\\' settings only - nothing but light blur on any other settings.  Printer going in the trash.  I will use my partner\\'s HP until I find which printer I want to replace with, likely another HP product.  One other thing I did not like about the Epson printer is it was very hard to recycle paper by using the backs of bad prints, because it loaded from the bottom, whereas all the HPs we had, load simply at the back straight up so you can put a recycled piece of paper in one piece at a time, when you are not printing something important.', \"I like this stapler a lot.

One of the top flaps is made with a crease to fold in, but the other side is not. So, when you try to grab the box by the cutouts/handles, one side closes in and the other side stays upright and your fingers barely even reach to both sides. Even if you have really long fingers, it would be very uncomfortable/awkward.

But, these labels are easy to use with MS Word templates.

I could have given these labels a 5 star rating but Amazon\\'s description of 5 stars is \"I Love It\".

Seriously, I tried on several different pages to tear out the paper along the \"dotted lines\". Not happening. Either the entire page tore out of the spiral, or the paper itself tore. I tried removing the frayed edges after the fact, nope. Once again I ended up with a torn page.This new feature is odd. It is supposed to make it so you can use both sides of your notebook at the same time. Couple of problems: 1.) The ring binding in the middle of the notebook is still in the way. 2.) These little tabs aren\\'t going to last. Maybe if they were made out of the plastic on the front cover and not the box board on the back.I think instead of re-inventing the wheel, Mead should go back and look at what is really important: lines you can see and pages that tear out cleanly.', \"As noted in one of the reviews.  The software is in great, but the fact it is powered by USB is one less chord to worry about.  I recommend it to anyone interested in a cheap portable scanner.  You'll fall in love with it.

Instead of having a big white area where there was no photograph.  It is cool.Peace out\", \"I like the size and the ease of this fax. It's really easy to set up and use.

This Swingline gets the job done quickly and precisely. Our only concern about it relates to the weight. It is made of composite material which makes it lighter than wood and it tends to move around a bit when using it. On the other hand, if it were made of solid oak or other hard wood, it would take two people to move it around from place to place.

They were mostly red so I wasn't sure how they would print on this paper.  They turned out perfect.  Luckily I have a printer where you can choose what you are printing on.  I selected tee shirt transfer and it printed the lettering backwards so when I ironed it on, it was correct. The transfer pealed off easily and the tee lookied like something you would purchase in a store.  My only issue, which may not have even been from the transfer paper was that the instructions said to leave a small border around the transfer when you cut it out.  I did and it looked fine until I washed it, then that border turned a light yellow.  If I had known that sooner, I would have cut the transfer exactly to size.  But overall I am happy with this purchase.\", 'i like sticky notes, but this is just a ploy to try to get you to buy \"something new.\" these are just regular ol\\' sticky notes packaged in very (and i mean VERY) thin stacks inside of a piece of paper with a tape strip to stick onto your laptop. seriously? why should i buy this instead of the much thicker stack that i can use instead? i see no good reason to buy this.', \"Admittedly I wasn't a big Trapper Keeper fan when I was a kid, I was one of those nerds carrying a huge zip-up folder because I carried so much stuff. But this folder just feels kind of flimsy, and I'm not sure why I'd use it. There's a plastic cover on the front like a page protector, and about as thin- your kid is going to ruin this on day one shoving it into a backpack or a locker. The inner rings aren't very sturdy either, it's sort of confusing that the included dividers don't even have normal holes they're designed with cutouts that &#34;snap&#34; over the rings. It's like the designers know their product can't stand up to repeated openings and closings (it can't) so they decided to make inserts that cut down on use.The only reason anyone I know got a Trapper Keeper in school was when they came with cool designs. This new line just seems kind of boring and cheap.\", 'A simple cartridge for your Dymo printer that prints black letters on white background. It is 1/2 inch wide and 23 feet long.

It definitely needs fine tuning.  The premise is great; the problem is in the execution.  It is too difficult to rearrange the papers.  Once you use the perforated pages, it's a hassle to organize the papers within the three colored tabs located in the back of the notepad.  I say buy a clipboard or folder(s) and shuffle your papers in the order of your desire.  I recommend that you wait until Ampad perfects their concept and skip this model.\", \"I bought these for my kindergartners to learn to write on their lined white board. I wanted them because they are larger than than most dry erase markers, and because they are shaped not to roll.They work well. The caps are actually a bit strange to work with, but aren't a detraction from using the pens. The colors are a bit streaky, which leaves a lot to be desired. Also, they don't wipe away completely. Most dry erase markers now, clean very well. With a dry cloth, you can barely tell anything was on the board. These leave colorful smears that don't come off with merely a dry cloth. So, yes they wipe off with a dry cloth, though not cleanly.In all, they work fine.

It's very tinny and distorted.  Also, when I recorded my outgoing message, there is an echo on my voice!What's with that?Messages left for me have even more of an echo on them.  You notice it more because it's louder and the echo is delayed more than with my outgoing message.The phone cord is hardwired and too short.  I have no idea what the logic is behind hardwiring the phone cord.  I'd like to be able to replace the cord if it fails or, as in my case,I would like to use a longer cord.

I am always looking for the \"perfect\" pen. Clearly, the attributes in this category are subjective according to personal taste. First, I wish the fat-body craze would die! It\\'s like trying to write with a club. However, I like the rubber grip, but does it have to be so big? The grip should be styled so that it is the same diameter as the pen barrel, or perhaps a bit smaller. So what would be the perfect pen here? Take the barrel color options of the G2 Pro, the styling of the G2 Limited, and the click-action of the Dr. Grip and combine them in one pen that is not quite so fat. Do this, and it would be 5 stars!', \"What can one say about these pens? They're about the most basic pens imaginable. They have a plain, cylindrical body, a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap, and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within. They won't win any beauty contests, but they do put ink on paper, and they do it cheaply. Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly. Other than that, these are perfectly adequate and the price really can't be beat.\", 'This printer has a lot of features (copying, scanning, faxing, duplex printing, duplex auto-feed) for the price, but you will end up paying an arm and a leg in ink costs if you use it very often.Like:- Image and scan quality (consistent w/ Canon\\'s usual great performance)- Auto feed duplex scanning: you can easily scan or copy a stack of paper- Duplex printing: great paper saver- Dual tray loading (rear and cassette)Dislike:- Wireless setup is a major pain.

They claim that the foot rocker helps reduce leg pressure, improve circulation, and reduce fatigue. The problem with most ergonomic products is that while they are designed to help avoid or relieve a variety of office space ailments, they are often over-priced, inconvenient, or don't work. They sometimes even make things worse. The challenge is to make an ergonomic product that actually does what it says, is affordable, and is convenient to use so that the user will continue to use it. How does the Fellowes Foot Rocker fare?PROS- Reasonably priced- Antimicrobial protectionCONS:- Very difficult to put together- Annoying squeaking noise when in use- Large size gets in the way- Didn't help me, personallyWhile the MSRP of the Fellowes Foot Rocker is pretty high, Amazon.com's price is actually very reasonable for a foot rest/rocker. Unfortunately, the reasonable price and the antimicrobial protection were the only positives I could find. Putting the rocker together was way too difficult. Figuring out how to attach the sides was an exercise is primal instincts. From the diagram provided, it should have been as easy as just sliding the sides in and locking them in place. I seriously stared at the sides and the diagram for about 15 minutes, wondering why the sides wouldn't slide in all the way. I finally lost my patience and slammed the sides against a door frame and got them in. Braun beats brain, 1-0. I am just amazed at how difficult Fellowes made the rocker assembly. A huge fail.Once I finally got it assembled, I threw it under my desk and started working right away. It didn't take me long to figure out that I was annoyed with it being there. I exercised as much patience as I could--about a day and a half--before I gave up on it. First of all, it squeaked each time I rocked it back and forth. Maybe it was the squeaking that wore on me but by the time I gave up, I really wanted to toss it out the window. Also, while I think footrests are a good idea in general, I didn't feel the rocker helped me at all. To top it off, I found it too large and cumbersome to have underneath my desk. When I went to put my chair in under my desk, the rocker got in the way or moved so when I came back to use it, I'd have to crawl under my desk to position it again.I don't know why office ergonomics hasn't improved much over the years, but it's a huge problem that I think a lot of us will only realize after it's too late. The amount of time that we are spending at our desks in front of computers is unprecedented. While I appreciate a well-known company like Fellowes offering an entire line of ergonomic products, I feel that they still have a lot of work to do. The Fellowes Foot Rocker isn't something I would put on an ergonomic essentials list and I can't recommend you do either.\", 'Fact is that HP and other printer manufacturers almost surely make little or no money selling printers, especially inkjet printers.  They make all of their money selling replacement ink cartridges.  These ink cartridges have laughably low capacities and are not cheap.  I have tried aftermarket substitutes (usually from China) with horrible results -- ink everywhere.  Plus the printer will constantly stop mid-job to tell you that your (full) ink cartridge is empty when you know it is full.  Or worse, that it is damaged or unusable.This XL black ink cartridge is not exactly a howling bargain.  But experience has taught me to avoid the third-party substitutes made in China.The HP cartridges are tricky.  For some HP printers some of the \"XL\" black cartridges are too wide to fit.  Plus, there are two types of black cartridges, the photo black (bowtie symbol) and regular black (pentagon symbol).  And if this is not confusing enough, sometime HP just puts a circle-black symbol on the ink, just to make sure that we are confused.Time was when there was one cartridge with all the ink colors.  The disadvantage here was that when one color ran out you had to throw the whole cartridge away even when other colors were not depleted.  Now, with color-specific cartridges, there is less waste.  But you will find yourself constantly changing cartridges as one or the other colors becomes depleted in the middle of a job or between jobs.  A significant trade-off.  I find it almost impossible to get through a print job without changing a cartridge on my HP inkjet printer.  Well, the Epsons and Canons are no better.  RJB.', 'This is a great presentation paper.

They adhered themselves to my envelopes like little soldiers...just as if their tiny little label lives depended on it...which, I suppose, they did.  There is room to write even the most pretentious European address, where they add all kinds of extra lines just to show off that they are in Europe, when we in America, the largest God Given Land Mass in The Continental World Of Its Kind, need just 3 lines.Does it mean we are better than those who live overseas?  Maybe.  And we don't have to talk with those fancy accents either, or in those foreign languages.  What's with them? When did they start with that? Do they think they are too good to speak English? Which is the language used in the Bible, so are they sending a message that way, too? Like to Satan or his mignons????BAnyway that is for each of us to determine in his or her own heart,and we are not here to talk about the snide, red-tinged and possibly devil worshiping Europeans, but about these Avery Labels, so let us return to our subject.  But you must admit, speaking a foreign language AND using more than 3 lines in an adress is just putting it on that one layer too thick.  .Okay, here we are, back to the labels again.  What makes Avery 1/2 X 1 3/4 Laser Printer Labels one notch better than your label (and certainly your inferior European label), what takes them to that semi-mythical Uber-label pantheon, is the stick up edge. You know when you have ten million labels to stick on envelopes and you try bending the page so the labels are easier to pull off,but some bend and some don't, and a couple even bend too far so they get stuck to themselves and you have to sneaky throw them away so no one will see?  Well finally somebody twigged to the need for a bent edge label and here it is.The bent edge does not make sticking labels on envelopes any less miserable, time-consuming and tedious a job, one more suited to, say, the Europeans. Labelling is awful work, particularly when one does it in one's office where one cannot turn the TV set on to watch Judge Judy, but the Avery Labels have that bent edge, a new High Tech Cutting Edge Design Element that makes the job go a little bit faster and every little bit helps.

There are interior pockets in the front and back, as well as a clear pocket on the front cover.

The rings have not taken any impact and haven't been opened/closed an excessive amount of time, yet the middle ring does not close entirely without me squeezing it shut.  Perhaps I opened the rings by pulling on the middle one too often (something I try not to do), but I've never had binder rings wear out this quickly, not even with more use.

I dropped this unwieldy thing 17 times while using it and found that a hacked-off rattlesnake would be easier to retrieve.Still, it does its job.

I forced myself to keep trying, however, and thanks to my curiosity, tenacity and trial-and-error, I finally managed to make a few cuts!Either I got a bum machine or they need to add a step to the setup/instructions; although they mention a strip of cutting surface that should be flipped every now and then, they fail to mention that said piece is covered in plastic, or that this plastic must be removed in order to cut properly - or even cut at all. I spent 10 minutes just trying to get the paper through, which didn\\'t happen because it was catching on the plastic - something I eventually found out by trying to pry apart the cover arm- and something not explained on the instructions.Even after figuring this out I wouldn\\'t recommend this cutter; the extra step of locking and unlocking the \"hold down arm\" are unnecessary and take just enough time to be obnoxious- especially since they don\\'t always actually hold the paper in place. I also found that small adjustments to the pressure on the rotary blade piece resulted in an edge that wasn\\'t perfectly straight.If you\\'ve got small kids at home and tend to keep your cutter out in the open, well, you may want to rethink that, but this might be just what you need. If, however, you don\\'t, I\\'d definitely go with a classic \"arm\" model, or perhaps a different/better rotary model instead.UPDATE: Apparently I wasn\\'t the only one with \"challenges\" re. the lack of direction re. the \"cutting mat\" and its placement... someone seems to have added an image of the problematic piece - complete with a note on the fact that it may have shifted in transport - to the product photos.', \"What can I say but plenty of rubber bands for many uses.They would be good for a newspaper delivery person and my grandkids like to use them for their rubber band guns.I only gave them a few so they don't shoot them all over the house.They stretch to about eight inches and come in several colors.\", \"Dear Stapler,You fit so snugly in the palm of my hand.

I stapled her folio to her registration card and you gave such a satisfying, violent-tinged snap.

Without you, most beloved of staplers, that transaction might have gone so wrong.And then you turned on me. Your slider would pop out with no warning, spilling your staples to the floor.

However, for the average letter size file cabinet or travel file carrier, these are a bit more pain then they are worth. I would probably stick with traditionally sized file folders.

I use it a lot for scanning and copying and it has helped me immensely; it looks pretty good too.It gets one star because it literally gobbles up all the ink. Sometimes I even wonder if somebody is using it while I am not at home.  I thought I got this for a good deal back in 2009 until I realized that they got their money back many times over through ink sales.  I only print in text mode and it still sucks up all the ink.  I don't even print pictures or anything like that.The scanning and copying capability are actually very useful and the Wi-Fi works flawlessly.I can also verify that the machine literally shuts down if you have only one empty cartridge.  Even if your black cartridge is full, if a color cartridge is out, the printer stops functioning till you refill it. It's like Epson is holding the printer hostage till you buy their ink.The printer is also a little noisy compared to some others that I have heard even in quiet mode.  It makes a very high pitched sound when printing. My old HP from 1998 was fairly quiet.  The carbon fiber look on the top is nice and the small display looks good as well.  It has a card reader as well which is useful but redundant in this day and age.I'd like to really give it a better rating because it has some useful features but the ink issue is just unacceptable.

I love using this scanner, when it works. I want PiQx to have a huge, out-of-control success with this product, and send dozens more manufacturers scrambling to get their own versions to market. (You\\'ll find comparable ones offered on the product\\'s page here, but they are mostly classroom/video oriented, and none can aspire to quite what the Xcanex is positioned to do in terms of document handling, format conversion, image quality, etc. -- not at this price.) But I can\\'t - yet - recommend this product to someone who needs consistently dependable results, or truly speedy scans  (there are other process streamlining features that compensate, I must hasten to add - more on that, below), or a not-so-steep learning curve.For business card and flat page scanning, I will say this little scanner is without peer. Practically anything strictly in 2D is going to come out cropped, lighting adjusted, and ready for OCR, conversion to PDF, or any number of graphics formats. Did I say \"ready\"? Actually, you can save to PDF format or to an OCR converted format, without intermediary steps. (Oh sure, if you OCR convert heavily italicized, stylized, or just plain tiny text, you might end up with un-decipherable gobbledygook, but that\\'s a limitation pretty universal to OCR readers, last I checked.)For scanning books, magazines, and other things that bend their way into hard to read text or bizarre images with traditional or \"wand\" scanners, PiQx has come up with software that they call \"Flatpage\". Its purpose: To \"unbend\" or \"un-skew\" curved and tilted page images and faithfully recreate the look of a truly flat page, without having to cut pages away from the book spine, for one example.That\\'s a great idea. However, it\\'s not working out so well for me, at this writing. I\\'m referencing here the original public release of Flatpage, which was made available on the PiQx website on 10/04/2013. Sometimes it works beautifully in automatic or semi-automatic mode. Sometimes it weirdly distorts the page in question. And occasionally, it doesn\\'t seem to do anything at all.Other issues:1) The Xcanex can compensate for the glare off of a glossy page, however it does so by means of tilting the scanner stand (or laptop screen) to a particular angle. Together with other variables involved in adjusting the scanner\\'s height, angle, etc., this can be a hugely frustrating experience. Time will tell if it becomes less so with practice, but that\\'s what early experience with the scanner and it\\'s manual has yielded, for me. In addition, images \"snapped\" using the glossy setting are often dark or \"underexposed\" - not an insurmountable problem for anyone who owns a half decent image editing program, but I do believe that the gorgeous images shown on Xcanex\\'s own site are the product of ideal, vs. real world conditions, and may not be representative of your results, yada yada.I would love to post some of my own images here by way of example, and urge Amazon or Xcanex, as applicable, to facilitate same. (Note that \"Share your own customer images\" is shown beneath the main product image for many, if not most of Amazon\\'s offerings.)2) The Xcanex is a resources hog. Yes, the bar is always being raised on processing power in computers, but the minimum specs given for systems installing this software are a little, um...optimistic? I was unable to do much with this software on my aging desktop - in fact I had anticipated as much, and getting this scanner was the push I needed to force some much-needed upgrades for my 2.4 GHz Quad Core system: I invested in some memory (going from 3 GB to 8), upgraded from a 32 bit to a 64 bit O.S., changed out the old HD for SSD...short of getting a new CPU and motherboard, I\\'m not sure what else I could have done to accommodate PiQx\\'s hardware recommendations. All I can say is that I can have a dozen programs open on the desktop and be humming along happily - even when one of them is something piggy like CorelDraw - but if I activate the Xcanex, I need to bring the load on system resources WAY down, pronto. The Xcanex spikes CPU utilization to 100% at or around the start of every scan, and it doesn\\'t cope well with having more than 8 or 10 images \"alive\" in the thumbnail panel.Oh, and you know how PiQx touts that you can scan more images while the last image \"snapped\" is still processing? Not necessarily. For me, second only to Flatpage, forcing the Xcanex to multitask that way is the leading cause of major image distortion.3) The Xcanex is pretty ergonomic for a laptop (works well in terms of portability and mobile space limitations), but for a desktop...I tried putting it on a side table. You can\\'t hold a book open at the same time you are trying to watch your adjustments on a screen way over to your right or left, oh, and run the keyboard at the same time. What\\'s a bit kludgy with a laptop is just ridiculous over the more spread-out desktop geometry. My solution is to position the Xcanex on its (included) desktop stand between my two monitors and shove the keyboard off to the side when it\\'s time to start scanning. Obviously this might not work for more space-limited desks, but I think that the convenience of the unit is somewhat lost, at least for a desktop environment, if you have to move and replace the whole scanner/pad assembly on a regular basis.4) The software is unintuitive. I\\'ve given somewhere between 25 and 35 hours, so far, to testing the scanner in everyday use, consulting the manual as I go. I still don\\'t think I know the half of how to get the best image out of this thing. There are a fair number of variables, menu and icon graphics are not particularly helpful, and the interface seems to be very much written for a windows/\"touch\" environment. Great if you\\'re using it on a tablet, not so much if your screen isn\\'t touch or - gasp! - you haven\\'t yet acclimated to the idiosyncrasies of Win8 or IDevice environments. (I\\'m kind of good, there, but it\\'s still fairly kludgy software for me.)At 90+ pages, the manual is useful I suppose as a start-to-finish read, not so much as a \"quick start\" reference. And really, how many of us devour manuals from cover to cover? I strongly recommend users of this scanner reference the tutorial videos on the Xcanex website.I can\\'t speak to the video features of this product because I really don\\'t video conference.Now after all that complaining, I still have to say that I love the potential that is abundantly evident in the Xcanex. It is no exaggeration to say that I have been waiting for this kind of scanner for *years*. Flatbeds are not particularly kind to books and magazines, sheet fed scanners can\\'t accommodate them at all (short of cutting the pages from the binding), and wand scanners like theWolverine PASS200 Handheld Portable Documents, Books and Photo Scannerare just plain disappointing in practical use. If PiQx can get the financial backing they apparently still seek - check their Facebook page and you\\'ll see that they are indeed looking - I think that the next generation of PiQx scanners, or maybe the one after that, will be A-Ma-Zing. That said, if you don\\'t have an urgent need for this kind of specialized scanner for research or what have you, I\\'d say wait a few years.However, if you do have that need, or just a serious appetite for the latest and greatest, you\\'ll find plenty of value in PiQx Xcanex. I find I\\'m using mine daily, and finally starting to make some small progress towards \"paperless\" in my own home office.Negative 3 stars for charging a fair chunk of change for a cumbersome, unintuitive interface, testy hardware ergonomics, and software that appears to be buggy or just not suited to less than ideal user situations. Five stars for innovation, potential and for the amazing things that the Xcanex CAN do, once you\\'ve learned to work around the various \"hiccups\".', 'I purchased this because I wanted a faster laser printer.

Below are my impressions of this 12 pocket folder.Likes:- It\\'s very sturdy; the front, back, sides, and bottom are all made from thick, stiff paper/cardboard.- According to the product description, it can hold over 900 pages (almost two reams worth of paper).  Based on my use, I\\'d say the claim is accurate, although I personally wouldn\\'t want to stuff quite that much into the folder.  (And as each pocket only expands to about 7/8 of an inch, you can only put about 1/12 of that 900 pages into any one pocket.)Con:- It doesn\\'t have a flap or drawstring to secure the folder from the top, so if it tips, things could fall out.Neither a pro or a con:- The product claims to be \"leather-like\".  What this means is that brown photo-textured paper covers the front and back of the folder.  While it isn\\'t unattractive, it really doesn\\'t add anything to the functionality of the folder, and I doubt many people are going to be \"displaying\" the folder.Overall, though, this is a sturdy, roomy pocket folder that will hold 12 months worth of paper for you.

But the rings snap together with a force that is a bit scary, and are hard to pry open.  The two \"pockets\" are so tight that you can barely put a couple pages in them.

Unfortunately, this is not a traveling file and it has no closure, which makes it's usefulness limited.

They essentially do the same thing that regular, store brand labels do.  The only exception is that they come in neat colors.  I found that printing on them works well,  but where they fall short is the peeling and re=sticking.  They come off, but leave a mark and then are not truly sticky enough to reapply and leave for a long period of time, which is the feature that I thought would make these labels worth paying the extra money for.  Also, I liked the idea of being able to color code files, these work great for that, but the fun colors alone aren't worth paying the extra cost.  I have found that I can use regular labels and print the letters themselves in color-which allows me to use the cheaper labels, but still have a color coded system that works just as well at a fraction of the cost.  In an economy where every penny counts, save yourself some money and pass on these over-priced, under performing labels!!\", \"I was a little disappointed with the size of his paper shredder.

You probably would not have thought anything wrong with the Fellowes texture until you compared them directly. Both products were the 3mil thickness, but the Scotch felt like they were slightly stiffer. The Fellowes seemed to generate a bit more static than the Scotch, making them slightly more difficult to align the document inside.Had the prices been reversed (currently, the Fellowes sells for 60% more than the Scotch.

Although it is noisy when printing, I have not had any of the paper feed issues that I see mentioned in other reviews.  I think the trick to avoiding the paper feed issue is to keep the paper bin less than half-full.  When I load the paper bin to near capacity, the printer does not feed properly.

Yet they are easily peeled from the sheet when it\\'s time to apply them.I strongly recommend that you investigate the \"Design and Print Online\" feature available on Avery\\'s website.

Using Avery\\'s \"Design and Print Online\" you most certainly can create 4-line labels as follows: Find and start \"Design and Print Online\" on Avery\\'s website. Enter the product number (8167) when prompted. Hit Next. Select the design you like (there are many to choose from). Important: select \"Enhanced Editing.\" Hit Next. Select a 7-point font. Important: you want a fine, gracile font like Garamond. Enter the first 3 lines of your address in the text box and hit Return after the 3rd line. The Text Entry box will expand downward to fit a 4th line. Enter your 4th line text. Click outside the text-entry box and then position your cursor over the box and click once so you get the 4-way arrow that lets you move the entire text-entry box. Re-center vertically. You\\'re done. Print and/or Save.Now, a 7-point font is kind of small. Your mail carrier will need his or her reading glasses. If your decision whether or not to purchase these is dependent on being able to do this, then you should try printing some 4-line, 7-point labels on plain paper and using Avery\\'s website to verify that you like the way they look. It might be better to just go for a larger label. The point is, you can do 4 lines in a half inch with these if you want.The package contains 25 sheets of labels with 80 labels per sheet for a total of 2000 labels. If you are an individual rather than a business, that should keep you in labels until the year 2129.These work well and, combined with Avery\\'s website, will allow you to create professional-looking, customized Return Address Labels so you can stop using the cheesy ones that your Insurance Agent sends you every Christmas.', 'ENOUGH TO WRITE YES OR NO!!

A part of a pencil broke off inside of the sharpener, it wouldn\\'t eject it, and then...kaput.To sum up:PROS:- Nice auto-sharpening -- this makes sharpening \"hands free\"- It doesn\\'t over-sharpen -- pencils are sharp, but not so sharp that they break the tip off the second you begin to write- Has a metal sensor so a kid can\\'t jam the eraser end in firstCONS:- Broke after 2 weeks of moderate use -- by ONE ADULT (me)!- Auto feature sometimes goes crazy & eats up almost the whole pencil- \"Reverse\" button (which you need if it goes crazy and won\\'t stop eating up the whole pencil) is ridiculously located UNDER, BEHIND the sharpener, by where the electric cord enters the sharpener (??) Dumb location.  You\\'d never find it in a hurry.- Part of a pencil broke off inside -- and to my disbelief, there is NO WAY TO TAKE THE SHARPENER APART to go in and retrieve the broken piece!  I couldn\\'t believe it...it just killed the sharpener.  Everything I tried failed, and ultimately, the sharpener went into a mode where it stayed in reverse forever, unless it was unplugged.  It just ran without stopping...the motor began to get hot and smell -- this could really have turned into a fire hazard if it overheated.So all in all, while I liked it at first, COME ON, breaks after just TWO WEEKS?!  And you cannot take it apart to retrieve a broken-off piece of wood??  Lame.  Waste of money.  Look for a sharpener that mentions that it can be cleaned or have its blades sharpened, because that means you will be able to retrieve anything that breaks off inside of it.Note:  I am a teacher, and I would NOT recommend this for kids.

A lot. In fact, I began to like the BiC\\'s so much that I found myself writing paragraphs like the next one.The classic BiC\\'s were designed exceptionally, like bizarrely well. And I don\\'t mean in a quaint, historical way. In a modern way -- no, in a *timeless* way -- the classic BiC\\'s adhere magnificently to principles of space, form, structure, density, and gravity. Because of their hexagonal shape, they require minimal plastic while also retaining a surprising strength (try snapping one), and the hexagonal grip points give the pens impressive writing stability. A tiny hole drilled in the barrel\\'s body keeps the air pressure the same both inside and outside the pen. Gravity feeds the thick ink down a tube to a free-spinning ball bearing that was manufactured within a fraction of a micron of accuracy.

The inputs are easier to enter, without having to memorize long sequences of key strokes.Your instructor and the class activities will most likely dictate which brand and model of calculator to purchase, rather than a reviewer's recommendations.  However, one bit of advice I can give you is very important to remember:  Please, use regular 1.5v alkaline batteries should you purchase this model.  The rechargeable batteries, with their 1.2v, will not be enough to give you a clear display.  A set of four batteries will last a very long time.  However, it would not be a bad idea to carry a spare pack of 4 in your briefcase or backpack.  You would not want to run out of battery in the middle of an important exam.  This calculator, unlike the more basic models, will not run on solar power.\", 'terrible in terms of quantity to price value. would never buy again. in fact, i got rid of the entire printer. this thing is so expensive, that after a cost analysis, i was better off investing in more expensive upfront laser printer.', \"Do the math, folks: this printer comes with 2,000 page toner cartridges and runs around three to four hundred bucks.  Each toner cartridge (there are 4) costs around eighty bucks so by the time you use 4,000 pages you've added a whopping three hundred fifty bucks (with tax) to the price.I did some research and found a Dell 3100cn laser for three hundred direct from Dell, which costs about the same and comes with full toners for a whopping 4,000 pages!!!The HP printer is smaller and prettier, though its print quality is not quite as good.  Its color output is slightly faster but its black and white output is super slow in comparison.  But bottom line is that 4,000 pages and another set of toners later, I would've had to pay TWICE as much as the Dell.Needless to say, I made a beeline to Dell's website.  Got the 3100cn for only three hundred clams with shipping, in fact.  Shweeeeeeet!\", \"This board is light and thin, but still does the trick. It comes with hanging hardware and is very easy to put on the wall in either direction.  The color is a nice tan color.  My only complaint is that b/c the cork part is a bit thin, you can't really hang anything too heavy on it b/c the tack won't go in far enough.  Overall, though it's a nice basic cork board\", \"Sturdy, durable and sleek.  In three words that sums up this wastebasket; it is just fantastic.  Most of my organizers and other office equipment are black and mesh and this coordinates perfectly with them.  Rubbermaid and Rolodex both intermix well especially in this black mesh design.  Comparing prices between local stores and Amazon have this product priced nearly the same.  I bought this at my local store to have it quicker however it's cost effective at the current price of under $10 no matter where you buy it.\", \"I've been happy with this printer and ink in the past so I'm giving two stars instead of one.  I buy the OEM ink to avoid printing problems; HOWEVER, the last one that I bought was defective.  It leaked black ink all over the inside of my printer.Amazon is amazing and is exchanging it for a new cartridge.  (I love their hassle free return policy).  But it took hours to clean the inside of my printer and it ruined my entire print job which was on the second side of a two sided print process when all the pages got smeared with streaks of black ink.  That means I also lost half the ink from the color cartridges as I had to re-print the entire job.I've never had this problem from an OEM cartridge before, but it only takes one to change my opinion and leave me severely disappointed in Epson.  I'd expect that this could happen from a re-fill, but from an OEM?  Maybe it's not worth the money to buy the cartridges new from Epson after all.\", 'I\\'m notorious for using things for purposes they were not intended for, and these labels are no exception. I don\\'t use them as mailing labels.When this big box of 3,000 labels arrived, I immediately pulled off a few of the labels and stuck them to the top and smooth side (vertically) of a half-pint canning jar and onto a ziplock bag and put them in the freezer. A day later, the labels were still adhering well, and yet they were not a complete pain to get off. (Try pulling the label off dry, and if it doesn\\'t come right off, it will come off after a soak in dishwater.) So now I can print out sheets of labels like \"08/2010 Tomato Sauce\" or \"2010 Okra Seeds\" and have them handy for when I\\'m canning, freezing, and dehydrating all my garden produce and saving seeds for next season. I put up a LOT of food. Also, I can quickly write and stick eat-by dates on anything in the fridge.Labels for canning jars cost a lot of money. These are just the ticket, and I can print whatever info onto them that I need. They will work at room temperature, in the fridge, or in the freezer, and there are lots and lots of them. Just what I needed!', \"This was easy to set up.  The suction cup doesn't really stick on very well, but I suppose that is part of the design, so that it can be moved easily.  I find that you have to hold the container with one hand while pulling the tape piece out with the other.  Not particularly convenient.\", \"This oil comes in a plastic container with a nozzle that makes it easy to lubricate the shredder. Yes, it is outrageously priced but it does the job it supposed to do. I just don't believe a product should be given a poor rating because of the price. I do believe that price is a factor in the purchase decision but not in the product itself. But, that's just my opinion. When I run out of the Fellowes lubricant I will refill the container with vegetable oil because of the price but not because of the quality of the Fellowes oil.\", 'My wife needed four heavy duty binders for her graduate class so I asked Vine to send me one from the monthly newsletter.  Let me just say that this is the one time that I received one unit (instead of the four described) and was happy not to get the other three.I was so surprised by the lack of quality that would allow the company to describe it as \"Heavy Duty\" that I went to Walmart and bought an Avery Dennison Heavy Duty binder and compared the two.  The price was the same and the Avery Dennison unit was superior in every way: stronger construction, \"one touch\" rings, four interior pockets, and much larger rings and binder size to hold up to 540 sheets of paper.But sometimes a company will stand behind their product  by having a good warranty to to offer you some protection. . So I emailed Wilson Jones customer service ten days ago and asked what their \"One Year Performance Guarantee\" really meant.  As of today I am still waiting for their answer.

It's small, has 3 sturdy binder clips and even has an inside pocket for pens, a calculator, a nail file, etc.  It's a great idea in theory.The problem is that unless I go to an office supply store, there is no common paper size that fits this.  I have short legal size notepads at home and without punching holes in the papers, it wouldn't work.When I tried to use this with the notepads I had, I misaligned the hole punch and had to deal with the messy rough edges from ripping the paper off the pad.  It's too time consuming, in my opinion, to find paper for this binder, punch holes in it and then load it into the binder - particularly when the end effect is it looks messy and disheveled.A more helpful way to market this product would be to have plenty of paper inside the binder, along with a note about what size paper to buy in the future.  That would make this binder much more user friendly.I would have given it 5 stars if it was packaged as I described.  It would have been very handy for recipes, a dream journal, to take to a meeting or in the car for notes.\", 'I used this item to make a sign that requires no additional material to hang.

I like to buy all my school supplies \"during the season\" for great deals like this.  Where else can you buy Avery Ready Index Dividers for a buck a piece?  I love these dividers because they are colorful, functional, and pre-labeled.  It really helps for organizing by loose-leaf binder books by chapter.  What a time saver!', 'So far I\\'ve had this printer almost two weeks, and I think I\\'ve finally figured out how to get it to stop crippling my system.At first, the drivers on the CD caused my internet connection to drop every minute or so. I downloaded the latest drivers from the HP website and at first it appeared that things improved, but I discovered that the drivers caused my computer to hang after a short time and hose my system so bad it wouldn\\'t even shut down! On one occasion of turning my computer off without shutting down, it actually messed up my operating system and I had to rebuild my machine!I can definitively trace the problem to the HP drivers because the problems occur only after installing the drivers, the problems disappear when the drivers are uninstalled, and even on a freshly built system I experience the same issues right after installing the HP drivers!For those stuck in a similar rut, here\\'s the steps I\\'ve gone through after many hours of tinkering and talking with HP support to get things working (hopefully):1. Download the latest drivers from the HP site. Version 4.42.0.0 seems to work okay.2. Don\\'t install the \"Smart Web Printing\" components (they may hang IE).3. Give your printer a static IP address through the controls on the physical printer (you can\\'t do it through the management software).4. Disable the three HP-related services in services.msc.5. DO NOT allow an automatic update installing the ~April 2008 Imaging Device Functions \"critical patch\" which will corrupt your system.Other than the driver problems, the printer itself is fantastic. I\\'ve had printers hooked up to print servers before, but never an all-in-one that allowed printing, scanning AND fax-related activities over the network. The supporting software is also fantastic. Not only can you launch a scan from your network-connected computer, but you can designate that you want it in a searchable format (.pdf, .rtf, etc.) and the optical character recognition (OCR) software does a good job of recognizing text and sizing it appropriately (thus the scan is not just an image, but a document whose text you can cut/paste/etc.).Also, apparently you have the ability to have received faxes save straight to your computer over the network instead of being printed out, the two-sided printing is better for the environment, as is the Energy Star rating which is a big plus in my book!In short, the driver situation makes this purchase a sketchy one, at least for Vista owners, but the great features and capabilities of this printer have me hanging on instead of returning the printer hoping that HP will eventually resolve the problems.UPDATE:Actually, even with the above tweaks, I still exprienced problems with the drivers crashing my system (e.g. freezing after waking up from sleep mode). I even went so far as to downgrade from 64-bit to 32-bit, but my system is still dragged down by this piece of garbage and there\\'s no ETA on an updated driver which has sat unchanged for at least three months.Sad. It\\'s a good product marred by awful drivers/software.I\\'d take both stars away if I could.SECOND UPDATE:If you\\'re looking for a good WiFi printer, but own Vista, consider theEpson WorkForce 600(which I\\'m now using successfully with Vista) orHP\\'s Officejet Wireless 6500, which is basically the \"certified for Vista\" version of the J6480.', \"Out of the box this item was plenty comfortable and colorful.

Unfortunately when I received the product my doubts were confirmed.This swivel tower is poorly designed and what\\'s even worse is that the build quality is also very poor.  First off, the tower isn\\'t even straight.  Each container is slightly lopsided. It looks like each container is bent when hanging from the center post.  You can clearly see this and I highly doubt that this is from a shipping defect because I tried to even bend them straight to no avail.  Secondly, each container swings from side to side too freely. Ideally, I would expect a little more resistance because I don\\'t want each container swinging from side to side as it makes it easier for the tower to fall over.  Lastly, the product itself just looks cheap.  I have other mesh containers which I bought from Staples and I thought that this swivel model would complement them...but I was wrong.  Even thought this swivel tower is a mesh design, it does not match the quality of the other items I own.  Fit and finish are just terrible on this model.

Each template can be customized and changed according to what you want to do with it.  Fun and easy to use.\", 'I had high hopes for this stapler, and on first try I liked it a lot. I really like the stapling mechanism, that is designed so that you don\\'t have to supply the pressure that actually folds the staples. It really is a \"one hand\" stapler, that\\'s very easy to operate. You can gently press down on the top until it reaches the bottom and then it shoots out a staple with a satisfying snap.On the other hand, there are two pretty serious flaws with the design. First of all, the spring loader, that\\'s supposed to push staples up to the front so that they\\'re ready when you are, is unreliable. I noticed that every few times I wasn\\'t getting a staple in the chamber, and that when I moved the stapler around staples had some room in the chamber to wiggle around. I opened it up to look, and then the spring popped out. I was able to get it back in there, and the stapler works now, but it doesn\\'t hold the staples tightly, and I have to lean it forward so that gravity ensures the staples are ready, when the spring is unreliable. It\\'s possible I got a \"dud\" but I noticed from another review that someone else had a similar problem, which makes me think it\\'s not just a fluke. The second problem is less significant, as it\\'s part of the design and not a mistake. It\\'s that there\\'s no way to open up the stapler at the hinge. I occasionally have need to staple things onto a bulletin board and the like, and for that you have to open up the stapler at the hinge. It\\'s not possible with this one.I really wanted to like this stapler, and I would have been able to overlook the fact that it doesn\\'t open at the hinge. The faulty spring loader, however, is a serious problem, and prevents me from giving it a strong recommendation. You might want to take your chances - since it looks like not everyone has faced this problem - but I\\'d suggest looking around for something else.', 'We had a Boston Nautilus SharpenerBoston Nautilus Battery-Powered - Sharpenerwhich recently was dropped and broke. That sharpener was great and had a lot more power than this one, even though it does not have the greatest reviews on Amazon.

The mechanism looks extremely fragile and you have to push the pencil in harder than on other sharpeners - and you have to hold on to the minuscule unit so it won\\'t spin.

Here is the breakdown.First, the perf\\'ed edges have come a long way, baby.  I can remember that back in the day, you might feel sheepish about handing someone an obviously perf-torn edged card.  Now, these cards aren\\'t going to have a sharp edge, like a professionally made card, they will have a soft edge.  But, I think the recipient is much more likely to critique your card design than the card construction.  Hats off to Avery for getting this down, its really quite good.Second, there are no less than FOUR count\\'m FOUR ways to print these cards.  You can do it through [...] without any download, for example, which is the most impressive.  Running lindows?  Red Hat?  Well, if the browser you are using isn\\'t completely whack, there is a fair chance you are going to be able to print these cards.  And if you can\\'t, well, its not Avery\\'s fault.  But the vast majority of us who are running IE and Windows will be happy that they don\\'t have to install/configure Word to get the job done.  Then you have the MS Word, option, which is ok but Word isn\\'t free.  Then there is another Word option, and finally Avery DesignPro.  Which I didn\\'t use, but I suspect its free, although it requires you to install software (PC/Mac).Third, these cards can be printed on both sides.  Hey, its only 2 x 3.5\" of real estate so both sides count.  For me, its useful to have my business card printed in English on one side, and a foreign language on the other.  I doubt thats going to be true for many people, but its a tribute to the flexibility this allows.Overall, I love this because you can print as FEW cards as you need of each kind.  If you really needed 80+ card that were all the same, you might want to try some of the online vendors.  But, at the time of this writing, these cards are a measly .11 ea (before the cost of your ink) and at that rate, I think you simply can\\'t go wrong.', \"This paper trimmer looks cheap (the body is gray plastic), but is sturdy and reliable and more than meets all our small office needs. Love the grid that helps you keep the paper straight. If you need more than a few sheets at a time cut, or other features like a spring-loaded arm, you should invest in a more expensive heavy-duty trimmer.

I don't need a high quality vellum for most of the projects and sketches I do, so this pack is great. You have the option of using 1/4 or 1/8 squares (front and back).

However, since this is a relatively new product, templates are not available in standard software such as Word.  Avery provides you with information on how to use on-line templates to design your tickets on-line.  I found the templates to be non-intuitive.  The templates did not allow me adequate creative options to design the tickets as I wanted them to appear.  Avery needs to do a much better design job with the templates, and then either include software with the blank tickets or offer consumers the option of downloading and maintaining the improved templates on their own hard drives.  Being dependent on a website to design and print is not convenient.  The tickets would have no value whatsoever to a consumer who did not have an internet connection.  You are on the right track with product design and quality Avery.  You just need to put some more effort into template design and functionality.', 'I see some of my fellow reviewers are unhappy that these boxes don\\'t do well when filled with heavy books.

This time I am in pursuit of my MBA with a concentration in Networking and Telecommunications. Why pursue a boring ole traditional MBA when new technology is to be learned?  So that means math; lots of math; loads of math in the form of algebra, calculus, and the ever dread statistics.Did I mention that I hate math!?  What does one do when one hates math, but still needs to do it in spades?  Buy a calculator of course, but not just any calculator I needed a calculator cable of doing complex mathematics including graphing equations.  My very first course called for a Texas Instruments \"TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator.\"Powered by (4) AAA-sized batteries (plus 1 CR-1616 or CR 1620 lithium battery for backup), the \"TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator\" is large unit ideal for advanced mathematics students high school algebra to college-level calculus, and statistics.  The TI-83 Plus packs a lot of mathematical punch and the price of $127.00 (Office Depot.com) certainly confirms it.The TI-83 Plus calculator combines features for statistical analysis, engineering, trigonometric and financial functions making it ideal for a student seeking an MBA.  Financial functions include TVM, cash flows and amortization, though surprisingly a percentage key is missing from the calculator.The two pound (yes, it is heavy, kind of) TI-83 Plus features a non-backlit 64x96 pixel grey scale LCD screen that is frankly hard to read unless the lighting is exactly right.  But the LCD display can display graphs and tables on a full as well as split-screen.  And the display exhibits up to (12) characters and eight lines.  The calculator can graph/trace equations while scrolling through table values.  And the TI-83 Plus can store and analyze up to 10 equations.I also purchased the optional TI-Graph Link (software and USB cable).  The software and cable allows one to connect the TI-83 Plus to a computer via a USB port permitting the transfer of files and data between the two devices.My ThoughtsAmple time should be given to learning what the TI-83 Plus can bring to the table.  All of the nine digits are there of course, but the face of the calculator contains a whole lot more in the form of multi-colored special function buttons; and there are a lot of them!  However, the TI-83 Plus ships with very detailed, instruction manual, so I plan to carry it with me at all times.As I stated above, and it is worth restating, the TI-83 Plus\\'s non-backlit LCD is a little difficult to read when the unit is lying flat on a desk and a lot will depend on the lighting conditions.  Even with the right lighting, the top line of the display is hard to read.Though I was stunned by the high price of the unit the \"Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator\" is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career, it is just that powerful.  You can buy it for a high school student and (s)he can use it through graduate school.', \"I'm a little surprised by all of the positive reviews here to be honest.The tabs are much thicker than I anticipated. I started thinking they'd be able to hold heavier sheets of paper (thick construction paper, artwork with glued on things, etc.)  No such luck.

Maybe it was the texture of the paper.I've since successfully hung a few single sheets of copy paper on the back of my office door.  I've tried to reposition them but the paper starts to tear and it threatens to peel the paint off the door.I think I'll take my chances with a piece of much less expensive tape.

I purchased a replacement cartridge for the black toner, and watched as the color cartridges ran down... baffled as next to no color printing was going on.  There is no way to set this printer on an Apple Mac computer to be black and white only.  When the Magenta toner ran out, the printer refused to print any further.  Even with a full black toner.I've gone through all the menus on the printer, on the Mac, searched the internet.  I am done with this printer and done for a while with Samsung (which is too bad as I have a number of their products).  Perhaps this is frustration and anger speaking, but really... how do you not allow the printing to continue with full black toner?!-----------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:I bought this printer for my mother as I was very satisfied with a Samsung laser that I own (CLP-620ND).Initially, I was very satisfied with the print quality and the features.  Networking was a pain to setup successfully on a Mac.Over time, I've become significantly jaded.  The wireless connection to this printer goes down all the time.  Not a big deal for me to handle if I owned the printer.  Not possible for my mother to handle.The biggest issue overall though is... this printer burned right through the black toner over a period of a year of very infrequent printing.  This is the exact reason I bought this... to get away from the ink jets.  I checked her impression level and it was far under the volume expected to be handled.And to add insult to injury, on top of the toner and network issues, pages that come fresh out of the printer appear to have some steam coming off of them.  What the heck?!Once I find a replacement color laser printer, this one is GONE.Avoid buying this.\", \"Heavy duty graph ruled paper .... great for doing things like spreadsheets & balancing your bank account.

What I like more is a good tape gun (like this one, which I use and love:3M Scotch Gray Box Sealing Tape Dispenser (H180)).  If you send a lot of packages, I'd suggest investing in one of those: they cost a little more up front, but they are easier to use, quicker, and more effective, once you get the hang of them.

I can print a 4x6 photo in under a minute. Regular black pages spit out quickly, too.The dual paper trays are a very nice touch. It makes it very easy to quickly pop in a piece of photo paper, then go back to printing on standard paper. It can also print on both sides of the paper, although that does take a bit longer.UPDATE: After owning this printer for about a year and a half, it's still working great.\", \"I do a lot of shipping and the tape  I'm used to is thick and strong so after being used to a high quality tape this I found difficult to use.

After reading about these Fellowes storage drawers I thought they might fit the bill, and to be sure they did help -- though in the end they are lacking in a few areas that make them less than ideal for my purposes.First, let me state these are very easy to put together.  It took me about 15 minutes to get all 6 assembled and ready.  They are fairly sturdy, and I was impressed at how much weight them seemed to be able to hold.  However, it soon became apparent that for people who need to reference documents frequently, or are storing them in a non-climate controlled environment, this solution is not for them.The drawers are formed by sliding the \"drawer\" assembly into a box.  While this is an innovative approach, I found that unless you are extremely careful that there is no way the drawers will \"line up\" correctly.  They are all a bit off, depending on how good your assembly skills are.  This isn\\'t too big a deal, but it can sure make it a pain when you are trying to slide open the drawers to retrieve stuff.  I ended up many times fighting to get the drawer closed again because it didn\\'t quite line up.Next, because there is nothing anchoring the drawers together you will find that they want to slide all over the place.  I finally overcame this problem by taking a roll of duct tape and literally wrapping several layers around the tops and sides.  Not an ideal solution, but it worked for me.Finally, the drawer handles themselves constantly are slipping in and out.  If you try to open one too fast they will literally pull right out.A good solution for those who need long-term solution in a climate controlled environment for papers and files they don\\'t access very often; for the rest of us -- probably should look at something more durable that can stand up to more frequent use.', \"I hate to say this, but this item looks like something you could buy in the dollar store.It's not very well made.

And it peeled off paint, new and old, flat and gloss - without taking any paint with it.

I have actually used it to hang smaller/lighter pictures in frames and none have come falling down..yet.

These slightly thicker labels are great, they feed through the printer without any problems (I'm using an HP D7360) and line up perfectly for my templates. With the normal style of Avery label I tend to pull off the outer grid, then raise each sticker one at a time - this can lead to wrinkled edges that don't stick as well. These new pop-up labels really do peel off easily and without edge damage but they don't come apart while printing. (I was afraid they would get stuck inside the printer - didn't happen). Definitely worth getting again and has a nice crisp appearance. I did see another reviewer had trouble with them sticking to poly bubble envelopes - with all my labels (except those on paper envelopes) I tend to cover them with a piece of clear tape, so I don't know if that is an issue or not. I did use them on that type of envelope, but with the tape applied as well.Updated 6/3/2012 - As these labels have aged they have developed some issues that make me reluctant to leave them with a 5 star rating. the adhesive has gotten less tacky, I now see more of the peeling the other reviewer reported. Equally annoying is a failure of my printer to recognize that these are printable. Because the easy peel has areas near the top that are not covered in label, my printer spits every fifth or sixth sheet out as unprintable. it can take a dozen re-feeds for the printer to stop thinking the page is upside down. Still love the quick release of these but the printer misfeeds are wearing me down.\", 'I have been a customer of HP for many years. Purchased several models of HP printers for my businesses and home. Always been very satisfied with the quality and value of their products until this purchase of HP Officejet 4500 All-in-One. Problems with printing, scanning and copying. Very erratic response to \"Print\" command, stops after one or two pages and often in mid-page. Scanning is even worse, scans halfway and often simply goes blank. Copying is very haphazard, sometimes it responds to \"Copy\" command but often simply whirrs and rumbles then nothing!!! Technical support is a joke ! It is indubitably and undoubtedly the very worst printer that I have ever purchased. This is not the expected HP quality, it is junk and that is exactly what I did with it...dumped it in the junk!', \"I would give this 5 stars for great adhesive and removability but the little tear off piece is terrible. The perforation is useless leaving a jagged ugly edge. I understand why they tried to market it this way since people are use to the pad form of Post-it products but these would have been much more user friendly had they left them as individual wax paper backed labels and sold them in the same zip lock storage pouch they already came in.I much prefer their product called Color-Coding Labels sold in an 8.5x11 sheet size format with waxed paper backing for easy removable labels. There are 4 colors rather then just two and they have clean rounded edges for a much nicer finished look. They can be printed on with your printer (the package I received was for laser, not sure they make them for inkjet?) but they are nice to hand write on as well and they are smaller labels 1''x2-5/8'' so they are great on file folders as well as other applications. They need to work on the above product some more I would not recommend them as they are now.\", 'I use these because I am a medical student that reads a lot of journals and I like to save particular articles of interest.  These were a great deal, and are very durable.  None of the sheets were torn or defective, and they are thicker than the ones I usually buy from the store (hence the heavyweight label).

Shortly afterwards, a small white plastic piece and another black plastic gear fell onto the kitchen countertop.  I'm not *that* strong, folks!  So I'm astonished that the whole unit would disintegrate in my hands just by my opening the battery compartment cover!  My wife figured out where the white plastic piece was supposed to go and tediously put the thing back together again so it could work.  I would have just pitched it into the garbage.What I HATE:- Poor quality!  Might as well buy a box of Crayola crayons that have a sharpener built-in to the box.  You'd have better luck with that.- Poor design!  The unit should not fall to pieces just by opening the battery cover.- Most battery-operated devices show polarity and/or battery position inside the battery compartment bay, so it's perfectly clear how to install the batteries.  With this poorly-designed unit, it's not obvious how to install the batteries, and the polarity is shown confusingly on the body of the sharpner, which, depending on how you're holding the pencil sharpener, can lead you to installing the batteries incorrectly.- Worst of all, we couldn't get a very sharp point on the pencils we tried sharpening.  The rotating razor blade will dull quickly if you use it much (presuming you *can* use it).  You'd be much better off with those little throw-away, pencil sharpener razors.  They take up almost no backpack space, don't use batteries, and would do at least as good of a job as this pencil sharpener does.Conclusion:  If you read this review and still buy this pencil sharpener, you have only yourself to blame.\", \"My husband bought this so he could label his files at work (since even HE can't usually read his own writing). One day, he brought it home so he could print labels while watching TV. Silly man. I started using it to make labels, and he's never been able to get it away from me.In the kids' rooms, I used it to label toy shelves and drawers so that even my pre-schooler knew where to put away his clean clothes. That was almost a year ago, and the labels have stayed in place through countless grubby fingers grabbing at them, as well as countless times I've scrubbed away at the marks those grubby fingers leave.In the kitchen, I didn't stop at labeling cannisters or jars. I labeled drawers, shelves and cupboards, too! Now, neither my husband nor the kids have an excuse to avoid emptying the dishwasher, because they know where everything goes! As in the kids' rooms, the labels have stayed put and held up to repeated cleanings.In the guest room, where the lightswitch operates three separate lights and a ceiling fan, I labeled the switch plate so my guests don't have to waste time flipping switches to find the one they want to turn on or off. Numerous visitors have commented on how helpful this has been, particularly when they're groggy in the morning.Of course, it's been essential in the storage room where clearly-written labels have saved us hours of hunting around in boxes and bins. I even labeled spots on my husband's tool bench. Now when I borrow a pair of pliers or screwdriver he's no longer complaining that I don't return it to the right place.This product is sturdy, too. My 5-year-old has taken a turn printing up labels and yanking out the tape. Although the tape has jammed in there a few times when he's done this (and I'm fairly certain any label-maker's tape would do the same thing), it's been a cinch to get straightened out. It's even survived being dropped on the floor a number of times.I am impressed, and I'm also addicted to this thing. Naturally, my friends and family members all teased me over my addicition... until I gave them each one. Now they're addicts, too!\", \"Now that I've finally learned to read and follow directions, I know why a couple of shredders crapped out on me so quickly.

And a little bit goes a long way.\", \"These look nice-- the colored tabs are bright and nicely transparent-- but the cardstock is thin and it seems like they're going to need reinforcements quickly. I guess they'd be fine if you're just going to use them on occasion, but if these are going into a binder that you'll flip through often, you can do better.\", 'So there\\'s some good and bad here. The good: for the most part, it\\'s powerful enough to sharpen well without bogging down like our old sharpener. Multiple guide holes are very useful, and the large, visible shavings bin is great. It holds a ton and you know when it\\'s time to empty it - a task that\\'s simple.Also, the thing has suction cup feet, so it doesn\\'t slide across a desk or counter while it\\'s in use - a great thing. And it sharpens to a point that\\'s quite pointy, which is nice if you need to use your pencil as a self-defense device.The problem, as some other reviewers have pointed out, is that it tends to sharpen unevenly. I\\'ve had pencils come out with a 1/4\" of graphite exposed on one side, and NONE on the other, making the pencil unusable. The solution is to let it spin a bit, rotating it around to try and get an even point, and that seems to help - though it\\'s still not consistently cut, and can cause the graphite to break.All in all, if I\\'d picked it up locally, I\\'d consider returning it. On the other hand, it may well be that in the case of the uneven sharpening, as my wife and son said \"they all do that.\" If that\\'s the case, I suppose the large shavings container and suction cup feet make it better than others I\\'ve seen. And it\\'s much better than the cheap consumer one we\\'ve had in the house for the last couple of years (which fills up too fast and bogs down constantly).So it\\'s a \"meh - it\\'s ok\" kinda review. The thing is good in some respects, but be prepared to figure out how to deal with the uneven sharpening.', 'I really wanted to like the Motorola DECT 6.0 Cordless phone as I loved the idea of being able to convergemy cell phone calls to my home phone.

The CO is the place where your telephone lines go after leaving your house and where the telephone company has all of its equipment.  I also did field telecommunications in the Army.In a natural disaster, cell phone towers have a very limited amount of battery backup.  That means your cell phone will not work about 5 - 8 hours after an earthquake.  That\\'s what happened to all of us after the \\'89 Loma Prieta earthquake.However, for landlines, the telephone company maintains a very extensive system of battery backup power in the Central Office so your landline phone will continue to work even after an emergency or after losing power (yes, your corded phone uses some electricity to work, but that electricity is produced by the phone company).  In fact, after the regular battery backup power is exhausted in the CO, the phone company has the capability to drop generator trucks to run the equipment and keep your corded phone working indefinitely.There also are other technical reasons that you want a landline in a natural disaster instead of a cell phone, but basically the equipment running your landline can handle many more calls when everyone picks up the phone at the same time to call \"911\" and their aunt Mildred.So, bottom line, keep your landline phone line and one of these very inexpensive AT&T; 210 CORDED phones on hand, if only for emergencies or when the power goes out and you can\\'t use your cordless phone or cell phone.

The wire spool which holds the notebook together has been looped so that there is no loose wire to catch on and wreck your sweater. There are pockets in the notebook to hold handouts and Syllabi from your teachers. The paper is nice, having nice perforations, so that you can tear off a piece of paper give it to a friend (or teacher) without them getting all those little bits of paper on them.So, spend a buck or so more than the cheapest thing you can buy.

It seemed to have all the features one would need to get started. The kit includes:1 storage binder1 clipboard2 Secure File Folders1 Envelope1 Media FileUpon opening it I thought the system felt very cheap. The binder is flimsy to me. All the parts which are included above are all plastic and somewhat see through. I was disappointed to find they are not made well and seem like given time they will tear at the seams of the plastic. I thought the `clip board' was something that could not be messed up but the clip board included is very flimsy as well and I could not sit with it on my leg and write on it. I expected the whole system to be made a lot better.I would not use it for everyday tasks but it would come in handy if you have an interview and you need to tuck your resume away and have something to store all your paperwork that is needed for an interview. Other that that, I could not think of much use for it. I did like the fact that the `envelope' section has an area to place a pen into. Most units like this do not have that feature so I was impressed with that. Sadly, I think this is something someone will buy and use once and store away after a presentation or might use here and there. I don't see it being used everyday as I mentioned above. Over all it is a great concept but I think the company made it too quickly with not putting much thought into the materials. I personally am not impressed and sadly would not recommend the system.\", \"This seems like a good idea; a simple cutting tool in the appearance of a computer mouse. Unfortunately, as others have already noted; it doesn't really work or is problematic at best. It was a good thought, but I'll be sticking with plain, old scissors. They get the job done and really aren't that much of a problem.\", 'These are a nice pen for about anything and priced well. Not worried about losing to those sneaky pen thieves that borrow and do not give back. Each one works great.', 'There were no directions, just pictures. I guess they figure you should know where everything is supposed to go! Like someone said about another chair, when you sit on it, you feel like you are hitting bottom (paraphrased). It feels okay, but not really comfortable. I cannot complain since it was fairly cheap. It does look nice and clean otherwise.', \"I purchased this paper cutter for home paper craft projects. It's very light, yet sturdy. I found the blade to be sharp and precise. The workspace is large enough to keep the paper supported and straight for most projects. I rated 4 stars instead of 5 because the blade is not sharp enough to do an edge trim. Based on what I was cutting, it can't go less than 1/8&#34; without chewing the side of the paper.\", 'I gave this ink a one star, because it was shipped in a padded envelope, with the cap off and the aluminum seal on the bottle came loose and ink went all over inside of the envelope - I had to just throw it away - What a mess!', \"Aside from one moderate issue, this freestanding dry erase board is great. The only problem with it is that it can be a bit hard to set up without assistance. The knobs that tighten down both the legs and lock the board at the desired angle are hard to turn while also holding everything where you want it. This is solved by laying the board flat on the ground, or by enlisting someone to assist you. Once set up, the board is perfect: stable, easy to write on, made very well, and light. We use three of them at my work place and all are excellent. This board will fit in the trunk of most cars, so it's great for presentations.4/5. A solid buy even with the somewhat difficult setup.\", 'These refills work as they should and they seem to last a long time. Zebra pens are quality pens and I use them for work everyday.', \"Working at a financial institution, I have been using Banker's Box brand boxes for years.  These medium-duty boxes live up to the company's well-deserved reputation.  They are sturdy, can hold a decent level of folders or other materials, and are easy to stack.  I use them at home to store a wide variety of items, and I've never had one break.  If you need storage at home, or at work, this will be an excellent choice.\", \"These inexpensive spiral notebooks are okay for general use, but if you're looking for something durable, you should look elsewhere.I have no complaints about the quality of the paper and don't have a perforation preference (these are *not* perforated). The problem I have with these is that the backing is so flimsy that the 70-sheet notebook flops about when you hold them. If that doesn't bother you, the 4-pack from Amazon is a pretty good value. Personally, I'd rather spend a few extra bucks and get something more durable.\", \"I can't believe I already need to start thinking about back-to-school supplies.... A 200 pack of wide ruled paper is always somewhere on that list.  And, since Mead has some of the best, most reliable products on the market, I'm glad I could start here.\", \"Once I tried this brand tape I have never bought anything but this kind since! I love how it goes on with a silky completely non-glare finish. The tape is strong and It doesn't seem to curl up on itself as much as other kinds do. It holds extremely well and in my opinion looks so much nicer than the shiney tape does. I really think if you try it you'll be hooked-or rather, stuck on it!\", \"This tape is thin, and you can use it effectively if you're careful, but you definitely have to get the 'feel' of it; imagine driving a new car with sensitive brakes. However, its tack-ness and thinness don't work all that well together, especially when it's hot, and I'd say 1 out of 10 pulls on the tape dispenser get ruined. So, bottom line, if you are not a 'rushed-type' person and you REALLY need to save money, this tape is worth the savings. But if you have some room in your equipment fund, use it for better stuff.\", 'I own two of these carts in different sizes. This one stays put in the kitchen and rotates my seasonal appliances; for example, I bake more in the winter than in summer so it holds large glass storage containers with flour, sugar, etc. In spring and summer it will rotate to hold my breadmaker, blender for summer fruit smoothies, etc.The second cart has moved from room to room over the years holding everything from office supplies, to books, storage boxes, extra clothing in closets, etc.Assembly is relatively easy, even if you aren\\'t very handy. It took me about fifteen minutes from start to finish and required only a rubber mallet to assist. The first attempt at assembly had things a little uneven because the plastic collars that hold the shelves at a certain height, the collars kept slipping as I would move to do the next leg. On the second try I had to \"lightly\" assemble the pieces and then firmly tap everything in place once all was set. Getting all four lightly seated worked better to have everything level at the end.My only real quibble is with the cheap casters; when doing my research on these it came up that they can seriously scratch fine wood floors. I don\\'t move these around much after they\\'ve been assigned a task so not a real big issue for me but something you may want to keep in mind if the rolling feature is important to you.These are fairly well made, pretty sturdy, and have performed well considering the budget price tag.

I have knocked off one star because the pad is black and my other black Fellows mouse pads have-- over time-- become dirty with oil and dusk from hands and fingers. You therefore need to wash them frequently.

The copyholder allows you to place a reference book, printout, or other material for use in writing a thesis, etc.  The bar allows you to hold your place while working on your computer.The heft and weight of the aparatus is sufficient to hold heavy books or large printouts without tipping over or loosing your place.Years ago, prior to the advent of the xerox machine, a copyholder was an essential desktop aparatus since administrative staff used typewriters and carbon paper to reproduce the original document placed in the copyholder.  Today we write documents on computers and include captions from books.  Another useful feature is organization - all paper documents (statements, bills, etc) can be stacked in the copyholder to pay bills using online banking.  This version can also hold electronic devices next to your pc (Ipad, etc) for easy transfer of data between your ipod and your pc.while not cheap, the 3M version is well built and will last a long time', \"HP Officejet Pro 8500A Plus Wireless e-All-in-One (CM756A#B1H)This is not my first HP printer but is the first one I got that was DOA. When I set up my printer for the first time, nothing I could do would make the sheet feeder, feed. I called tech support and went through basic trouble shooting with him. After he determined it was truly broken he arrange a swap out. He warned me that I would get a refurbished unit. I had no recourse as Amazon Vine supplied the unit and I knew they had no more. So I processed the request with the tech. The replacement printer arrived quickly and to my surprise it wasn't in a plain box. As a matter of fact it was a brand new printer and it all worked right out of the box. This was better than expected and overall a good experience using HP tech support.Now for the all-in-one printer. It is fairly fast at printing. That said, it's kind of noisy too. There always seems to be activity going on and it's noisy activity. Also, this printer jams more often than any other printer I've ever owned, mostly from the internal tray. I think there is, IMHO, a design flaw in the tray design. There is no tension bar to slide into place behind the paper stack.  I think this lack of pressure at the rear of the paper lets it go slack over time and the result is a jam. I've never had a printer that didn't snug up the paper stack. The actual print quality is pretty good. Text is sharp and pictures are crisp. This is not a photo printer but if you use photo paper the results are very acceptable. It is a good mix of service. Still if you need excellent quality photos this is not the printer for you.This printer is a duplexing printer and will also photo copy in the duplex mode. This worked very well but I did get a jam once on a 30 page duplex test run. I did test some HP Premium Presentation Paper and the results using pictures and text was quite nice. I was very pleased with the resulting document.The touch display is large and easy to use, but sometimes I have to press twice to register the command. It also uses large ink cartridges which can be expensive, but you won't have to replace them as often as some. The prerequisite media readers are present too and work as expected. Overall this is a decent device but I can't give it a whole hearted recommendation. A nice bonus was my iPad could print to this printer starting mid-December.  I consider it a mid-level performer and not really up to the HP standards of the past.Update: July 8, 2011It jams and jams and jams. I rerate this to a one star printer. Stay away. Sorry HP. Disappointed.Update: November 8, 2011After the last firmware update the jamming problem has reduced. You could blow me over with a feather to believe software would fix a jamming issue. I'd still say avoid this one. I saw the new 8600 at a Staples store. They redesigned it with a normal removable paper tray. It has an adjustable brace at the rear of the paper. LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE HAD ON THIS ONE!!!\", 'I am on my third pack of Avery half-fold cards in only about a year\\'s time. I love this product! Aside from the typical print-out greeting cards, I use the cardstock for a couple of other things as well: (1) They\\'re scored deeply enough that they rip in half easily. Once ripped in half, I cut along the line to make it look neater, fold each half of cardstock in half, and then make two handmade cards out of one sheet. (2) The cardstock works really well as a cover when creating half-fold booklet projects.One thing that\\'s different about this product from others is that it comes with envelopes. Plenty of other brands only sell cardstock in packs, and this envelope size isn\\'t always easy to find. The printing is also less likely to smear than some other types of heavy paper since the surface isn\\'t glossy.The only negative I have to say is that this packet used to come with 25 cards and envelopes (my old box reads: \"5 more cards! Now with 25 cards.\"). I really wish Avery had kept the pack at a larger size and not taken it back down to 20. The actual product is great, though, and something I use frequently.', 'Owned 6 HP Printers over 20 year span...bought the HP Deskjet 952C WORKHORSE that LASTED almost 20 years of CONSTANT printing including photo printing and an 855C for my kids.  Then I bought 4 more in the last 2 months that were ALL DEFECTIVE including this one!!Very familiar with these...what HP has done is make the printers cheaper and ink cartridges SMALLER so you pay for the printer, (IF it works for a few months), over and OVER again; it\\'s a \"MONEY THING\" and people are buying these blindly without doing the research.**Please do yourself a favor and invest in an inexpensive LASER Printer instead that will be much more cost effective in the end.  Really see what meets your needs and buy that one, not the cheapest one!!**~>GOOD LUCK!!', 'The 1\" wide scotch magic tape I wanted has a 3\" diameter core. This dispenser is for tape with a 1\" diameter core. I had to buy a more expensive 3\" diameter office dispenser (which I really like)', 'This tape is proving to be very useful.  Thus far, it has held securely.  You can even use it to hold up a big table-top flush against the wall.  The only problem that you have to be careful with the paint.  If you decide that you hung up your picture in the wrong place and try to move it, some of the paint may come off.  Although I guess you should expect that.  It is, after all, permanent tape.  All, in all, it delivers on its promise: allowing you to hang things up without bothering with nails.  And the price is right.  I recommend it.', 'This is the best mounting tape I have ever used and I swear by it! If I want something to stick on then I will use this tape. This is the gorilla tape of double sided tapes.

It has feet on its back so that it can be stored standing up (with the electric cord removed) to save space when not in use.Basically, it is a glorified paper punch.  As such, I am not particularly impressed.  For the price, I was assuming a little more automation, so I think that offices that bind a large number of reports will want to send their work out to a service bureau unless they have a minimum wage worker to do the binding.  Here\\'s why, in my opinion:  while you punch up to 25 sheets at a time, you manually align the holes with the tabs of the open plastic \\'comb\\'.  For larger documents, you will keep adjusting the comb opening lever to expose more of the comb \\'teeth\\' to stack additional pages.  This is a time consuming operation.  Releasing the comb lever for the final binding is of course a piece of cake.Never having used such a binder before, I had assumed before delivery that the vertical metal teeth that you can see in the photos would be where one stacked the pages and the machine would automatically thread the comb through the whole stack.  It turns out the vertical teeth are only for aligning the teeth of the plastic comb in the opening mechanism.  The paper has to be stacked on the curled open comb teeth,  Not something I\\'d want to spend my time doing with 100 reports that are 1/2\" or more each.A plus of the machine is that the binding mechanism lifts out of a storage tray inside the unit, so that two people can do the work - one punching, the other binding.A big negative is the instructions / user guide.  This is perhaps the worst user guide for any device I have ever encountered.  My favorite step was step 6:  \"Insert the plastic comb into the opening mechanism\".  There was no illustration for how to insert or exactly how the opening mechanism and binder worked.  Even the video on the Fellowes web site does not show how to do this.  So, it was trial and error until I figured it out.  Similarly, this machine has \\'releasable dies\\' which avoid punching in positions 15, 20 and/or 21.  That is about all the manual says.  It never explains why you would use them.Were the unit much cheaper and had a decent user manual, I would give it a higher rating.  Were it to have a smarter binding mechanism that did not require manually threading pages onto curled comb teeth, I would give it a higher rating at the current price.  So, it\\'s not great, not terrible, but just OK, hence my 3 stars.', \"BE VERY CAREFUL!!  I JUST INSTALLED THE FIRST OF THE BLACK CARTRIDGES.

But overall these work well.\", 'I got these because the price of  $2.00 dollars was just  right. The pen write smooth and makes my hand writing look sleek. The only down side to this pen is that it is not bright enough. The red ink in the pen is not bright red but dull red, other then that all good. I would say buy it at this price, You could never have enough pen.', \"For less than five bucks, this bag of 100 white cord clips is very reasonably.  My one gripe is that the nails on these clips are short enough that you might have issues getting them to stay in the wall.  That is to say: you can hammer them in, but they don't go far enough in to be stable.That said, for applications where the cords won't be bumped or touched, they seem to work fine.\", \"This stapler fits my needs perfectly. I use it at home for the occasional time I need to staple something and to help my kids with projects or school work. I've owned this brand before and have never had any problems with light use. I would not recommend this for an office environment when it would be used multiple times on a daily basis. I could see it getting jammed or busted easily under that sort of use.\", \"I received this binder free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review, and that's what you're getting. If I had paid $20 for this binder, I would be super disappointed (and not just because I have since read all the one-star reviews about the toxic vinyl chemicals it contains). The cover is indeed &#34;fancier&#34; than a typical 3-ring binder, but it's also flimsier feeling and not as solid. You can flex and bend the entire binder easily with your hand, which I'm not concerned will damage my papers, but I just don't like the feel of it. The pen-holder thing broke before I even used it (I have a bad habit of pulling tags off instead of cutting them off, and pulling the tag ripped the pen holder off right along with it).It is basically just a glorified 3-ring binder on the inside. It has decent three rings that seem strong enough, a slot for a business card, and a thin pocket on both the front and back covers that could perhaps hold one or two sheets of paper. It isn't anything fancy, and aside from the pretty cover, which I think looks better in the picture than it does in real life, this is just a binder. Is it worth $20? Not in my opinion. Ten or fifteen dollars, maybe.I can see why the high-star reviews are from people who are using these as a professional presentation binder, because they do look nicer than a plastic binder, BUT for everyday functionality, I would keep looking.\", \"I recvd Avery lavel dividers and heavy duty EZD ring binder.

Note that 3 inch and 4 inch wide versions are available. Especially at 4 inches, that's much wider than any packing tape, and therefore useful for repairing bindings on books, magazines, and other published items.Here's a more meaningful explanation from another site:  3M 845 Book Tape is a tough crystal-clear transparent tape with a long-aging, synthetic adhesive that conforms readily to book contours and flexes with cover movements. Excellent for repairing, reinforcing, protecting and covering bound edges and surfaces. Use on books, magazines, pamphlets, record album jackets and more. The transparent polypropylene backing has excellent clarity which doesn't hide title information or printing and saves time and money by eliminating relabeling. It is tough, flexible, resists abrasion and cracking, and is conformable which reduces rebinding or replacement costs. Its synthetic adhesive is long aging and will not discolor or dry out so it won't deteriorate with time causing possible subsequent repair.\", \"Scotch gift wrapping tape is wonderful.

I love this tape!\", 'This is an unusual tool designed to cut straight or curved lines out of cardstock (one sheet thick) or clipping coupons.  The cutting blade is located on the under surface of the tool, but hidden deep beneath a red-colored plastic \"paper guide\".  The manufacturer states that this design makes it safe for children to use.  (Probing this guide with my finger caused it to pop off, though it was easy to replace.)  There are two sets of wheels which glide the mouse so no mat is needed to protect the cutting surface.However this tool seems a bit gimmicky to me.  The manufacturer demonstrates the ease at which it can cut strips of paper, but the accuracy does not match that of a paper cutter or exacto with a ruler.  Its design would seem to be useful for cutting coupons, but most paper crafting requires more precision than this tool can afford.  It does not match scissors for versatility for either adult or child.This is a new product and the manufacturer brushes aside questions about how and under what circumstances the blade may become dull by saying that, \"...you would have to do an awful lot of paper cutting before that would be a problem...I give it two stars for novelty.', \"We've only ever use Scotch tape at my house, it's the tape that holds up better in not ripping or tearing when you don't want it to.

Compared to my trusty Panasonic Electric Sharpener, which I've used fror 30-odd years, it's muchheavier, can sharpen any common pencil size, and seems designed for constant use. Artists and office workers should getthe most out of this unit. It may not be the best choice for schools; they should probably stick to the old standby hand-crank sharpeners. As to its long-term reliability, I frankly have no idea. However, the Super Pro 6 has some heavy-dutyfeatures. Among these are an industrial fan-cooled motor with thermal protection, a dual helical cutter, a large-capacityshavings receptacle and a heavy grounded power cord.One feature that I wish the Super Pro 6 had would be an auto shut-off feature. My Panasonic has this: it shuts off whenthe pencil is sharpened. With the Bostitch unit, a change in motor sound and decrease in resistance indicates propersharpening. You may go through some pencils in the process of getting used to this. The owner's manual states thatpencils with uncentered leads will not sharpen properly, so pencils of good quality would seem to be mandatory with thisunit. I do like the Super Pro 6's Tip Saver Technology, which ensures a nice pencil point instead of an overdone, needle-like point that's sure to break. (Many lesser sharpeners have this problem.)The Bostitch Super Pro 6 is not such a great deal at its inflated list price, but I would absolutely give it a shot atthe current amazon price. Again, I'm not sure about its performance in the long term, but I will update this review if Ishould run into any problems. As it stands right now, I recommend the Super Pro 6.\", \"This product is nothing more than a very small knife/dull razor blade.  The blade is small, so it is safer than using a box cutter, but it is also nearly impossible to follow the contours of some packaging.  I prefer sticking to the tried and true razor blade or scissors.  I have never cut myself when opening plastic packages with a razor blade, so that's how I will continue to do it.The design of the package opener is not good and I can't figure out why they decided to make the blade aim down from the handle instead of out the front like everyone is accustomed to from using knives and razor blades over the years.In short, I do not recommend this unit and highly recommend sticking with the razor blade or scissors.

Maybe in the future Avery could include a CD, with the templates on it, so that you can just copy them on to your computer.Hopefully you\\'ve got an Internet connection because going online to Avery\\'s site is the best bet and makes creating the cards a snap! The Avery site has all these options and for free. You have to register in order to access the good stuff but they only ask for name and email address and you can opt out of getting email notices from them. Anyway here\\'s what\\'s on the site:***Pre-Designed and Blank templates for Mac & Window users which can be downloaded.***You can customize and design the business cards on the site without needing MS WORD or other program. There\\'s a design wizard that guides you through the entire process and you can save the design on your computer and print right from the site.***Different fonts are available online and there\\'s also illustrations and stock photos that you can use in your design.***Step-by-step directions on printing the cards and what to do to align your printer if need be.I tried both methods to create my business cards and by far the online version was easiest. From start to finish the process was simple and user friendly. I printed the cards up and only had to adjust the alignment a little.This great product should help save money on pro-business cards and might bring calling cards back in style (OK, maybe not-lol).', \"I used up the strip in one night.

Sometimes it also get jammed because they tend to stick together.

It\\'s CLEARLY designed to be put under your desk at work because the cord is simply not long enough to be used anywhere else. It has a nubby top but the unit doesn\\'t move so you\\'d have to move your feet yourself to get any kind of massage effect. So how does the \"Climate Control\" work? Well, first of all you have to take off any shoes and socks to feel the heating or cooling.  Both the heating and cooling operate on a singlel fan so the temperature is most definitely not evenly distributed. You\\'ll end up cramming your feet up in the top center of the unit or in the case of the high heat setting on the edge to avoid the blistering heat.Given that this is summer time the cooling fan was more appropriate but it really doesn\\'t cool it just blows and as I said it\\'s not at all evenly distributed. I tried the heat but I imagine that if it\\'s cold enough that I want my feet warmed it\\'s probably so cold that I wouldn\\'t want to take my shoes and socks off. I\\'d have warm bottoms to my feet as the tops of my feet and my ankles suffer.I tried the footrest for a while but quickly got bored of it and feel no need to use it further. Besides the unreasonably short cord I also would have preferred an on off button that could be pressed with your foot rather than bending down under your desk to turn it off an on.

Unfortunately neither works well. The reveal-n-seal is a strip in the middle to top third of the envelope that you fold up to reveal the adhesive. It\\'s better than licking the glue on an envelope. But the standard type of adhesive where you peel away the waxy paper strip on the top flap is easiest, simplest, and works best. In short, the reveal-n-seal technology (patented) is un-necessary and tries too hard. It\\'s an envelope! Worse, the blue patterning inside won\\'t completely conceal what\\'s inside.

This is a laughably small roll of tape for a move.  I think I'd need 30-40 of these just for one move.  That's just not economical.

I also like that I can write on the divider itself in the same way.  I have been adding an index on the actual divider in some cases.

Generally, they do not print well or at all, and the last one I tried wasn\\'t even recognized by the printer (Canon).

Out of the box they are very well organized and seperated into 5 packets. Each pack comes with a clear cover. The cover is not as strong as the tab covers. They are made of a lighter material. It will do the job to protect your work, but would have preferred them to be as strong and as clear as the first clear tab. There are 8 multiple colored tabs. 1 orange, 1 white, 2 green, 2 yellow and 2 blue. In the back is a clear folio flap. They're all 3 hole punched and it comes with a white sheet template to help create the perfect typed tabs. There is no cutting out and placing tabs into a slot. You place the tab index at the back of the document. It's debateble whether or not I am a big fan of this. I do not want to see all the titles as I flip through the document, but there is an advantage to this and they're still very well organized. There are free templates for the tabs that can be downloaded at their website.

Recommended product.', \"The previous sorters I've seen look kind of awkward to have around, like this--C-Line General Purpose Plastic Sorter, Letter Size, 32 Divisions, 3 x 23-1/2 Inches, Blue (30532). What if, after you've sorted, you don't have time to file or process the items right away? Where are you going to put the alphabetized pile of stuff, considering that you don't want the papers knocked out of place before you can get back to it? This sorter solves the problem by keeping everything contained within a notebook-like cover.I recently went through a backlog of mail using this sorter, and it was a big improvement over my previous method. Usually I spread things out on a tabletop, in piles by category-it takes up a lot of space! This time I tucked things right into the sorter, using letters to designate my categories, like B for bills, R for bank statements to be reconciled, F for filing, and so forth. Then I was able to put everything aside neatly until I was ready to work on paperwork again.After trying some similar types of organizers from Mead, my only complaint about this one is that it seems a bit old-fashioned. The cover is made of a kind of coated pressed board that I seem to remember from my childhood, and I'm no youngster. The corners were already bumped when I received it. It's sturdy enough, but I don't think it's going to stay looking as nice as the plastic covers on the Mead products. Also, the Mead organizers come with elastic closures, which make for easier transport. Nonetheless, I'd recommend it and would purchase another one if need be, as a replacement or for use by another family member.\", 'This product weighs a ton, or at least way more than a document holder made for sheets of paper.  Also, unless your monitor is well above the desk, anything you put in this will block the screen, plus you need room front to back room between your keyboard and monitor.

The reinforced strip on the paper helps prevent tearing and makes sure it stays in your project binder/notebook.

Even then, worth it.\", \"I've been using Scotch Gift Wrap Tape for years and there is nothing better. Cheaper tape can be fine for general purpose taping (although I still prefer 3M products), but for gift-wrapping, quality is a must. This tape dispenses evenly and easily, cuts cleanly, applies easily, and is truly nearly invisible once applied. The tape holds well as long as stress is lateral to the tape. When the stress is perpendicular to the tape, it sometimes lifts. This is rarely the case when gift-wrapping. I think it is slightly less tacky than general-purpose tape. Sometimes you can lift it off if you make a mistake, but gift-wrap paper tends to be unforgiving. Because it is nearly invisible when applied, it is often best to cut the seam and leave the tape on the paper if you make a mistake. It is not noticeable. There is not must else to say about tape.\", \"I am not impressed.  Sure, if you manage to get it just right, your tabs will look gorgeous.  But it is SO difficult to get right!

The card stock is lightweight and will not jam or print lopsided because the card stock is too thick for underpowered home printers.  The perforated edge is clean, although you can still see the minute perforations if you look closely.  The cards separate easily from each other yet do not fall part in the printer during the printing process.  The finish is matte and both Laser printing and Ink Jet printing print well and look decent.I would recommend this product for casual home use and for quick printing. (Avery templates are easy to use and lined-up well with both my printers at home and at work). However if you need something that is professional looking, I would recommend buying another product made from thicker card stock.  The weight/thickness was not printed on the packaging and so it was impossible to tell how thick the card stock was on this product.Not recommended if you're going for a professional feel/look - card stock too lightweight.\", 'I read the five reviews before writing this review.  Let me quantify this review by noting that I have had at least 5 shredders.  The first two were the best; they lasted years and didn\\'t have auto shut off features.  They also shredded into bags so clean up was no effort.  Over the years, I noticed a trend with the progression of technology.  In my opinion, the quality of the shredders has decreased because of the additional features and the machines becoming \"sensitive\".  It seems they have a shorter \"\\'life-span\" while performing less.This Dirt Devil shedder is my first Dirt Devil.  I found this unit to be esthetically pleasing.  It\\'s sleek yet substantial.  Yes, it\\'s heavy duty in construction. The unit I received appears to be unused, brand new.  The unit comes with the wheels attached.  Whew, my previous shredder was by Fellowes (Fellowes Powershred 100% Jam Prooof 79C1 14 Sheet Cross-cut Paper Shredder); and, attaching the wheels was a project so this was definitely a relief for me this time.  However, I am not in love with this shredder like other reviewers.  I had difficulty even turning on the unit.  In fact, I had to call customer service.  As previously stated, you do have to have 3 things going for you to get the unit to work.  The back button (on and off switch located on the back of the unit), the plastic lock out key must remain in the unit, and the power button on the unit must be turned on for the unit to work.  The instructions definitely need a revision because it was unclear.The unit has a beautiful blue light that illuminates the keys (power, forward, and reverse) on top of the unit as well as the bin that the papers shred into.  I wish this unit held a bag because the micro shredded papers goes everywhere every time the bin is opened. Every time I open the bin shredded paper floats out of the bin, making a mess in the surrounding area.  This limits where you can use the unit. The bin fills too quickly for my needs.  In fact, the unit\\'s bin button (soft white light) lights up even when the bin isn\\'t full which becomes very frustrating.The unit makes more noise than I would like; definitely not quiet as it shreds; but, it isn\\'t so loud that it hurts your ears.  The auto shutoff is another annoying feature.  The unit needs to cool off far too long and too frequently.  This is not a unit for commercial use to say the least.  I put a paper with a staple attached to see what would happen.  I was surprised that the unit shredded the paper as though there was no staple attached.  The instructions recommend that staples not go through the shredder.  It is also recommended that envelopes or paper with any adhesive not go through the shredder as it may cause damage to the blades.  Well of course I tested that as well.  Again I was pleasantly surprised that the unit didn\\'t seem fazed by the task.  This unit makes cross cut micro confetti out your documents so your identity will definitely be protected.  Based on my experience with shredders, I would not recommend this one because I believe there are better shredders out there.  The features on this Dirt Devil make this unit too challenging to use.  You become a slave to the unit\\'s sensitivities rather it being a piece of machinery that performs as you demand.  I don\\'t like waiting for the unit to cool off so I can use it when all I\\'m trying to do is shred the day\\'s mail.  It is your choice to make; but, don\\'t get mad if you are disappointed by this purchase.', \"When my 'toner' light when on on my printer even before my prints started to look faded, I was suspicious that there was still more usable life and toner in the cartridge. After doing an internet, search, I discovered that if you put masking or electrical tape over the hole on the side of the toner cartridge, you can get 1000 more prints out of it!There is a passthrough hole where the printer shines a light through the cartridge. Cover that up, and the printer still thinks there is plenty of toner and will continue to work. When your prints start coming out faded, you can then replace the toner cartridge. Much more environmentally friend and cost effective than to replace it when the print thinks you should, even if it's not empty.\", 'Great price on the phone, but quality of sound is not good.

It's simple, basic black and the perfect 9.2 x 8.3 inches that have almost become an industry standard. There are no duckies, Hawaiian tropical flowers, basset hounds, sports team logos, photos of Sports IllustratedSports Illustrated swimsuit models, hot air balloons, comic book characters, or images of mountains that you'll probably never visit. It's just a basic black mouse pad; nothing more, nothing less.But... oh, the smell! Maybe that's an added feature, a freebie that wasn't noted in the product specs?Actually, there's a fast and easy solution to remove that somewhat noxious odor, but bear with me so that you'll understand the logic. Some of the first mouse pads were actually made from manufacturer's scrap of the same neoprene foam backed with a thin sheet of nylon or Spandex that we find in Scuba and free-divewetsuits, and some of us made out own mouse pads from worn out or badly torn wetsuits.So what does this have to do with smelly mouse pads?That's easy: those old wetsuits stunk when new, but one hoped the atrocious smell would go away by the second or third dive. However, they smelled like a cross between a wet dog and dead opossum road kill when left in a plastic bag in the trunk of a car for a few days after a dive, so they had to be washed... and quickly. Today we have products such as Sink The Stink Wetsuit Wash and others to deal with getting rid of the stench. But these cost more than the mouse pad itself, which is ridiculous.The solution is simple: wash the mousepad thoroughly with your standard kitchen dishwashing soap. Good old green Palmolive works fine. Rinse it and gently wring out the excess water, then wash it again the same way (think of it like shampooing your hair). Set it on a flat surface between layers of paper towels to blot up the excess water. Depending on your climate, it should be dry and ready to use within a day or two.  I'm not going to suggest that you try this, but there are some of us who take our mouse pads and put them in the washing machine with older dark clothes. Just remember to not put them in a clothes dryer.OK, back to the mouse pad.It's good, it's priced right, it's functional, it will work with just about any mouse, be it optical or the older one with mouse balls. Wash it and get rid of that smell that makes one think you pulled it out of a garbage dump or an old tire recycling plant and it will last a long time.9/5/2012\", \"My 4th grader was told that they could use calculators in class.

I did seem to have a cool way of holding folders in place, but I didn't need to use that for what I was doing with it. Getting items in and out of the various storage options is cumbersome and I felt i could do almost as well with a cardboard box.

Overcomplicated, bulky and cheaply made means I would have most likely asked for a refund if I hadn't received this through the Vine program.\", \"There are many applications for this tape, but our favorite is in kids projects.  The foam layer between the two sides of tape allows you to connect two surfaces that would not lie completely flush against each other (making it impossible to use regular two-sided tape).  The foam also gives a little bit of flexibility and shock resistance; for example, mounting something inside a remote control vehicle.  Also, while this is meant as permanent tape, the foam layer can, in some applications, give you a way to pry off whatever you've taped.  We keep a roll of this on our workshop bench as there is invariably some situation where it is preferable to gluing, nailing, sewing, velcroing, etc.\", 'Despite being very happy with my HP Officejet 7310, the ink has turned out to be a painful expense.  In the past six months, I have gone through three of these cartridges. I hate to single HP out, but the entire inkjet industry is guilty of fighting price transparency with inexpensive printers and inflated ink.  This is not to mention the constant changing of ink cartridges models. Does HP really need 200 different models of ink cartridges?  No. It would, in fact, be much cheaper to consolidate the cartridge offerings.  However, this would lead to excessive duplication and remanufacturing by third parties.What is particularly amusing, and perhaps offensive to some, is the enclosed \"recycling\" envelope that comes with new HP ink cartridges. This prepaid envelope, with the empty cartridge, goes back to HP so that it can demonstrate its environmental leadership. Of course, HP doesn\\'t want the empty cartridges to go back into the hands of companies that refill and remanufacture them. Although I haven\\'t done the calculations, I would assume the transportation and handling costs would actually do more harm than good to the environment. My suggestion is to fill the prepaid envelope with torn up remains of the consumer packaging that comes with the cartridges.', 'cheap plastic casing and inks will dry easily because of the opening at the tip but a hassle free all in one go purchase if you need a large number of colors', \"I have a bad lower back and currently enrolled in physical therapy.

FWIW - It has a bit, but not entirely, now onto the review.As others alluded to, this is an expensive piece of plastic. It is very cheaply made. It has two levels that you can chose from a higher or lower resting level. This has a rocker like motion so that you're feet aren't in a set position all the time.

I use my whiteboard all the time, so I figured these would be a great solution for easily cleaning my board without having to use any sprays. The white spongy side worked fine- not great, but fine- it took off the marker and left some ghost writing, just like my standard erasers do. I read the instructions about getting the sponge wet to remove the ghost writing, so I tried it...all it did was smear any writing that was there (I tried it both with writing on and off the board) and leave huge water marks behind.Before writing this review, I came to see what others were writing and I was really confused with all the 4-5 star ratings on these erasers. I figured I did something wrong, so I gave the erasers a second chance. I tried again- following the instructions, as I thought I did before- and had the same problems. I was comforted to see another low review from someone who experienced similar problems.Since these are just sponges, they don't seem like they're going to last very long. I'd rather stick with my standard whiteboard erasers that are less expensive but do the job just fine.\", \"the rings open up too easily an then after not long, they don't even close correctly.\", 'When buying this, make sure these are OEM and new products and not the outdated and remanufactured type or you will be sending them back like I did.', \"What can I say about hole reinforcements other than they work well.

Pages are clear, relatively fast to print, and actually pretty quiet too.  The scanner works well, and the copy function is really simple.  (I couldn't test the fax function, since I don't have a land line phone).Where the trouble starts is in the wireless functionality.  First, while setting it up, I found that it simply would not find my router that was sitting right next to it.  It found all of my neighbors' routers, but not mine.  After numerous attempts at setting it up, I nearly gave up.  In the end, I lifted my router about six inches and tilted it over the printer, and viola, I had connection!  Unfortunately, I have to hold the router just like that in order to maintain the connection.  As long as you set this printer up in a different place from your router (like your neighbor's house, perhaps?) you'll have no problems.  Unfortunately, that isn't an option for me right now.The next issue comes with iPhone/iPad printing.  The box prominently shows printing from iPad and iPhone, but the printer is NOT airprint compatible.  As usual, you need a special app (that doesn't work) in order to print from an iOS device.  This isn't a special feature.  Any printer can do this.  In fact, if you download FingerPrint to your computer, then any printer becomes an airprint printer.  In this case, it is just a printer.\", \"They work well, but if you don't use it for a long time it will dry up and make it impossible to write with.\", \"Well it's oil, I'm sure how one can rate this.

This copy holder helps you keep a book in a slanted upright position so that you can refer to it easily. Thanks to the extra heavy base, it can really be any book, including a dictionary. The elastic band keeps the book open and can serve as a line guide. So what's not to like?It turns out that in everyday use, I start to grow tired of it. First it is the size. 18 inch is REALLY big, which is great if you need to hold a book open or have two sheets of letter-sized paper side-by-side. But when the holder is empty, it's really quite noticeable if left in front of the monitor. Fine, I will remove it when empty. But the base is heavy, and the holder is not easily collapsible. (Both of these are in fact PROS in my mind.)There are a CONS. The elastic band that holds the book open is not easily adjustable if you only want to use one hand. It also seems that this elastic band is the weakest component and will surely break the earliest. But it's hard to tell how long it will hold.Overall, I would say that this is great if you need an industrial grade copy holder on a regular basis, with regular being the keyword here.\", \"I'm going along with the many other reviewers out there who feel a little confused & misled by this product name.

Well again I got to review something that worked wonderfully well and it was these dividers.Instead of writing on actual tabs and then realizing you wrote things wrong and need to start over and then you end up with a mess and not enough tabs. This system works so well because you can print the 'tab' headings on one piece of paper through your printer. You can get the file to use to set up the page at the website listed on the packaging. The packaging also tells you how to set it up yourself, but I was a bit to lazy to try that. So I printed out the tabs I needed. Since I had such a huge stack, I ended up using 2 sets, which equaled 16 tabs.

Just load a full page into your printer (I have a laser printer) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes. These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification.\", 'I give the tape itself 5 stars -it is fantastic, and is really the best tape to use on wrapping paper, because it does a great job of disappearing.  It is MUCH better, in fact, than the typical Scotch tape which can be removed and reused if not put on correctly --and which is not fully see through.  Though that tape also does a great job when used for wrapping, the Satin Finish tape is better.The only problem I had is that I was really surprised at how little tape came on each of these three rolls; it was ridiculous.  I had a \"regular\" single roll of Scotch Satin Tape and the tape on THAT roll was at LEAST three times the diameter of the tape on each of these 3-pack rolls.  So, the bottom line is that these three rolls of tape seem to have less tape than a single roll of the regular sized Scotch Satin Tape.  Basically if you like to have more rolls of tape lying around (for example, useful if other people are helping you wrap) AND the three rolls are cheaper, together, than a single roll, then go for the three rolls.  If, however, you like having less clutter, less wasting of resources (more plastic going into the garbage), and NOT running out of tape in the middle of wrapping, go for the single roll.  (The single roll also has the advantage of having a stronger case -and is sealed on both the front and the back.You can\\'t go wrong with the quality of this product, just with the amount of waste, and the amount of tape you get for your money.Recommended as a single roll.  Not recommended as a three pack unless multiple people are wrapping at the same time.', \"It's ink...it works.

I wish the app would provide a select area to print function as I don't need all the ads when I print from my phone (website).Overall, I'm giving this a two star rating, as it seems like printers should be able to have longer ink life and the wireless should be easier to use.

It included rubber foot pegs that you can put on the pad underneath to choose your angle. Those have not fallen off in the six or so months that I have been using the mouse pad. overall, I love it.

Peeling one off gave the paper a bit of a curl. This sticky notes have an additional sticky strip about 4/5th down the note so you can have another point of adhesion. It almost works, too. However, since the paper still has a bit of a curl, one of the mildly-adhesive sticky ends tends to detach under the tension. It's usually the top strip that doesn't hold--I think it adheres to well to the pad and curls significantly as I peel it off. Peeling side to side is difficult, and even then the note still curls.I do like these for sticking on the the sides of monitors though, using only the edge for attachment. With the additional adhesive strip the notes stay in place.

I liked the TI-30XS MultiView because of the large display, but I later found out the 30XS MV lacked many features found on the Casio FX-115ES scientific non-graphing calculator and even other TI graphing calculators. After evaluating the FX-115ES scientific non-graphing calculator and TI-30XS MV, I came to the conclusion that the FX-115ES scientific non-graphing calculator is by FAR the superior calculator.The TI-30XS MV is too basic of a calculator. I\\'d recommend it for elementary school use, perhaps even for algebra. For example it is unable to evaluate integrals or differentials and there is no direct option to select different logarithm bases using the 30XS (every second counts on a timed exam and I\\'d rather buy a scientific non-graphing calculator that handles different logarithmic bases directly). The 30XS also lacks the ability to process matrices which the Casio FX-115ES scientific non-graphing calculator does process. The 30XS does not recognize the imaginary domain, hence the lack of \"i\" or \"j\" (try to do square root of -1). This makes the 30XS useless for engineers that have to deal with the imaginary domain for vectors, polar math, etc... especially on timed exams. That reminds me, the 30XS cannot handle phasor angles intuitively. There\\'s a whole menu system for angles that I have yet to figure out. One would imagine the creator of the TI-8x graphing calculators would make a half-way decent scientific calculator, but instead we end up with a children\\'s calculator. In case you haven\\'t noticed, the Casio FX-115ES scientific non-graphing calculator is clearly superior and performs many functions that are omitted on the TI-30XS.Pros: Affordable scientific calculator, dual-power supply (Solar and battery), TI interface (intuitive for existing TI users), nice displayCons: Funky hard-cover (doesn\\'t slide in place like all other TI calculators), lack of a large number of important features. There\\'s also a limit to how many characters or instructions you can put into a single line. I was adding up my grocery list and it ran out of memory.Bottom line: I recommend looking at the Casio FX-115ES scientific non-graphing calculator instead of the TI-30XS MultiView, although the TI-30XS MV isn\\'t physically a bad calculator. I just felt it was a child\\'s toy compared to the Casio FX-115ES scientific non-graphing calculator.', 'These Sarasa gel pens are great to write with. The ink flows evenly and smoothly. However, as with all gel pens, the ink does not last as long as it does with an old-fashioned ball-point pen. If you use these pen for art work (as I do) you need to know that the ink in the light blue pen is almost as dark as the ink in the navy pen. Also, the burgundy ink is more of a dark brown than a dark red (although that is true for other brands as well). Over all, these are some of the best gel pens available (although pricy $$$).', 'These labels are what I have needed for years. We are always returning items and also often sell items on ebay.

However, it can be cumbersome if you are a frequently packaging.  Since there is no dispenser, then when you use a roll, you let the tape stick back on itself -- necessitating that you find the edge and peel it back every single time you go to use it a fresh time.  Not such a bad payoff if you're the occasional user and want to throw a roll in your desk drawer without a huge dispenser taking up room.  But if you frequently package boxes for delivery, you'd be better off with the right tool for the job and that would involve a packaging tape dispenser and regular ol' packing tape will do in that case.\", 'We bought these to use for Christmas cards.

However, to people who are thinking of purchasing it with their hard-earned money, I can only say that it is not worth it. I see absolutely nothing in this binder to justify the $11.75 price. It looks quite cheap, so you won't impress your clients or business partners with it. They will think you picked it up for a buck at a dollar store somewhere. The cover is a bit puckered right from the start, from the very moment when you unwrap it. With use (and I'm talking about really moderate use here), the puckering gets worse.On the positive side, the binder has a very good mechanism that opens and snaps closed the rings. This is a useful feature that other binders lack. However, this great and useful characteristic is not enough to justify the price and make up for the poor look of the binder. I hope that the makers of this product start inserting the great locking mechanism into better-looking and cheaper binders. Until then, I will not be purchasing this product.\", 'To quote from Gilbert and Sullivan: \"An insult, but a light one.\" So why make a fuss about BIC\\'s \"gender-specific\" attempt to sell a good pen?  To begin with, many modern women are offended at being \"characterized\" (more often, stereotyped) on the basis of gender.  As we\\'ve learned from much feminist thought (excluding some more recent psychoanalytic French women theorists who became influential after Simone de Beauvoire\\'s seminal \"The Second Sex\"), there is no \"essential\" difference between female and male consciousness. Hence, male authors such as James Joyce (Molly Bloom\\'s monologue, occupying the last third of \"Ulysses\" and, perhaps above all, William Faulkner (Addie Bundren, \"As I Lay Dying,\" and Rosa Coldfield, \"Absalom, Absalom!) have represented the consciousness of female characters in comprehensive, penetrating, surgically precise prose/poetry that, at the least, matches the same authors\\' male characterizations. Consequently, Bic\\'s pitch of what should be a gender-neutral product to a female audience is unlikely to meet with a warm reception in academe, especially since the 1970s. \"Essentialism\" is a nemesis if not a dirty word many Western feminists would expunge from all discourse about gender differences.  Just look at the patronizingly patriarchal discourse of the Republican Party during the present Presidential campaign: male candidates for high office are talking about \"legislating women\\'s right to choose\"--in the 2nd decade of the new millennium!Still, even a feminist (and I don\\'t exclude myself from that number) need not take serious offense at Bic\\'s attempt to win women\\'s favor.  Despite the flowery, Victorian, dainty colors (they\\'re anything but garish), this is after all not a \"fine\" but a \"medium point\" pen.  Moreover, the barrel is surprisingly solid and large.  It\\'s grip-friendly for the largest hands (and perhaps for some smaller ones).  The diameter is noticeably thicker and more rugged than the popular Bic Atlantis pen.  In fact, the barrel of this pen is bigger than any other ballpoint--Papermate, Pilot, Bic--in my large collection (I\\'m addicted to ballpoint pens and am especially fastidious about things like grip, flow, smoothness).One feature I did not realize until using this pen is that the colorful \"flowery\" barrel is not merely decorative: it indicates the color of the ink.  I had no idea that I would not merely be seeing red and violet on the pen but inscribing notes in those same colors.  So the BIC Her Fashion gets a \"high five\" for any ball pen users seeking alternatives to the universal, predictable, potentially bland and boring blue and black ink of most ball points.There\\'s some initial resistance in getting the pen to loosen up and move freely, but after several minutes it was literally sailing through my stationery, leaving in its wake refreshing colors that I have no doubt some correspondents will relish as much as I.  If you\\'re a male, open up to the wisdom of all cultures concerning gender. The yin and the yang, the anima and the animus are not mutually exclusive.  We all have--in our chromosomes and genetic make-up--psychological, emotional, and physical traits normally associated with the \"other\" sex.  And admitting to those traits can be a healthy exercise in self-examination as well as promotion of better understanding of what we as human beings have in common.So, go on--pick up two packs of these pens and share them with your male friends.  By employing the pen, men can at once congratulate BIC on a good product DESPITE--not because of--its  steretypically feminine adornments.', \"It does sharpen though I found that the &#34;Sharp Sense&#34; technology either doesn't work or doesn't work for me (or my other two family member who tried it after I couldn't &#34;sense&#34; it, even though my kid & I have hypersensitive systems & can &#34;feel&#34; a car idling in the lot a few floors down, behind closed doors & windows, at the other end of our modern masonry construction, three story, sound dampening apartment building so Sharp Sense seemed like it would work for us).

This headset already has enough wireless range to cover half the floor in my building, so the ability to answer the phone at such a distance is extremely useful in a bunch of situations.

Also, the handset cord is short, so I bought a longer cord, also from Amazon, so I can walk around my office a little bit while talking on the phone.  The phone's sound through the handset is very clear.EDITED to add: After 6 months the display faded so that it is now illegible.  I depend upon the caller ID, so I can let calls from 800 numbers and the like ring through to voice mail, and the lack of caller ID means I have to talk to people trying to sell me something or miss important calls.

It had replaced a loathsome Epson which had convinced me never to own another Epson. Well, *this* HP has convinced me to never own another HP printer.The HP Photosmart C7280 All-in-One may be the worst printer in the history of printers.This printer is _helpful_. It knows what kind of paper you have and what kind of printing you want to do. It is oh-so-clever about everything. It knows more about what you want to do than you do. Heaven save you from helpful printers. I\\'m currently printing CD labels. The printer _helpfully_ notices that the shiny side of my \"photo\" paper is down. It spits out the label sheet (blank) and chirpily informs me I need to turn the paper upsidedown. Not really wanting to print my labels on the backing, rather than the label, I stuff the sheet back in and hit okay. Then it chirpily informs me there\\'s a paper mismatch with the previous type. An okay on this might yield me two uninterrupted sheets printed before having to go through this miserable process again. Go ahead, turn off every automatic feature and detection feature there is, it doesn\\'t help.Then one of the minuscule half-dozen print cartridges will become empty and the printer will refuse to print anything until it\\'s replaced. I\\'m often not sure how the [obscure, seldom-used] color cartridge became empty as what I was printing didn\\'t use that color. Sometimes I come to use the printer and will find a color cartridge has supposedly gone empty while sitting doing nothing. This printer is annoying and hideously expensive to run.On the plus side, once you do get the wretched thing to grace you with the boon of an actually printed page, the quality is gorgeous. The printing speed is very fast, but that\\'s irrelevant because of how much time it takes to get to the fast printing. Genuine speed to get to the finished product makes this the slowest printer I\\'ve ever had.This doesn\\'t even get us to the scanner, which is its own tangle of \"helpful\" features.Horrid, horrid, horrid printer.', \"These aren't index cards really.

I use these pens on fine pen and ink drawings for highlights and fun accents.I prefer the sargent ones as their lines are finer, the ink stays put and they have a better sparkle now that I've used both.These pens have a medium point line and the ink dries slowly so it can smear if you are not careful.Most sparkle ink dries slowly, so that is just an FYI for all the lefties out there like myself--otherwise you'll erase as you draw!On several occasions the silver one has 'blobbed' when I went to place a line, but the color is very nice, and this particular color I like better than the Sargent one. So I am very careful. If you are using them for crafting and this isn't an issue then they are a great buy. If doing more fine art--then try the sargent fine point ones instead. The caps fall off easy on these too...but, hey--the price is right to buy both and experiment!*update Feb 2013: These have actually become my favorite pens because of the sparkle factor in the ink. They DO blob and they DO run and if touched before dry they smear--BUT, if you are aware of this and use them wisely--the SPARKLE and the light in the colors, especially the metalic green and blues-are unmatched by any other pens I have. The Sargent ones are much more expensive too.I also 'blob' them in a puddle and use a fine point brush to work now.

The package of Avery white half-fold greeting cards containing 20 each of card stock and envelopes, is perfect for this endeavor.

The quality and sturdiness of the card stock is a big plus. It is a good weight...not heavy, but not too light, either!

Plus it has poor adjustability and _no_ instructions on adjusting.I am 5\\'10\" tall and this chair was much too small for me. I have had a number of visitors try it and the results are that a 5\\'0\" woman loves it, but it is on the borderline for women 5\\'5\"-5\\'6\" which I assume results of different proportions (legs, contours of back). All the men who tried it were 5\\'7\" or taller and found it to be too small. You might check this range against the other reviews here, but at the time I last scanned other reviews, 5\\'5\" was the tallest I saw for someone who liked the chair.The chair comes with absolutely _no_ instructions for adjusting the chair. Some adjustments are obvious, some not. The mechanism for adjusting the chair\\'s height is the conventional lever and works well. The levers for adjusting the arm rests are easy enough to find and operate.Adjusting the seat back-----------------------With experimentation, I determined that the seat back adjustment was a ratcheting system with 6 positions. Should you raise the back above that sixth position, you need to return it all the way to the bottom and start again.When I first got the chair, getting the mechanism to engage was not easy. Many times it took some jiggling and other fine movements to engage. And sometimes, I just wasn\\'t able to get it to engage, and had to start over from the bottom. However, as I asked visitors to try the chair to see who it might fit, the ratcheting mechanism got broken in, and adjustment became much easier: The positions were much easier to feel and hear (the clicks went from muted to loud). My estimate is that the break-in involved cycling the back dozens of times.There was a related problem of the chair back staying in place. When I first got the chair, the slightest disturbance could cause it to drop to the bottom, for example, leaning forward or bumping it while walking by. However, the broken-in mechanism is much more robust in holding its position.On lack of instructions: During the early period, the only visitors that could figure out how to adjust the back were fellow engineers. For other people, the clues were too ambiguous for them to do the repetitions needed to get the back to stay in place.Tilt Adjustment---------------There is a knob under that chair that has left multiple other reviewers here perplexed. As best I can determine, it provides a _slight_ adjustment in the tilt of the seat.1. Experimenting with the chair upside-down, I can see a slight movement. However, with someone sitting in the chair, she couldn\\'t sense any change.2. The observed change occurred only during a tiny portion of the time I was turning the knob -- most of the time there seemed to be nothing happening.3. I was unable to adjust the chair while sitting in it. While I could just reach the knob, I couldn\\'t get enough of a grip to effectively turn the knob. The 5\\'0\" woman who liked the chair was unable to even reach it. If you are going to try this adjustment, you may have to have a friend lay on the floor and reach up to do the necessary turning.One other reviewer speculated that this knob adjusted the firmness of the seat, but my examination of the mechanism didn\\'t find anything that would allow such.Other reviewers here stated that the height adjustment lever would also allow unlock the mechanism and allow you to tilt the chair back. I was unable to get their description to work, nor see the any part of the mechanism that would allow such. Consequently, I suspect that there are several slightly different mechanisms being shipped under the model number (a single reviewer reported an additional lever that allowed forward/back adjustment of the seat pan).Other details-------------1. The seat pan does not adjust. For 5\\'10\" me, this leaves my legs feeling unsupported, like on a bar stool. There is a 6-inch gap between the front of the seat pan and the back of my calves.2. The seat back does not adjust up enough to come even faintly close to matching the contour of _my_ back. My 5\\'0\" visitor found the 2nd or 3rd position (of 6) to be good for her.3. The arm rests are hard plastic with a concave contour, but you cannot adjust the angle. The contour presumes that you rest your arms straight forward rather than angling in. If you do the latter -- as most people do -- your arms will be uncomfortably on the ridge of that contour. Even if this wasn\\'t a problem, the arm rests may be mounted too far back to be supportive -- for me, half was behind my elbows. Most of the chair models I see have padded _convex_ armrests which provide comfort at many angles. The advantage of a concave contour is that it helps keep your arm on the rest, but for me that has never been an issue.4. A petite person using this chair might find the arm rests too wide. The narrowest setting is 16-inches between the insides of the rests, a distance which was appropriate for me.5. The one positive was that the chair assembled quickly and easily. For this, there was an instruction sheet: It told you to do the obvious -- take the large red cap off the shaft before inserting it into the obvious hole that it obviously wouldn\\'t fit into if the cap were still on.6. The shipping box says that it is to moved by two people, and it makes no accommodation to having to be handled by a lone person, such as the driver of a delivery truck or the person receiving it. The handholds common on similar large format boxes are not present, but since this is a Vine item, this may be the preliminary packaging and the production version may be better. Note: If you are small enough to fit in this chair, you are likely too small to be able to move this container by yourself.The packing of the components inside the box seemed adequate to protect them from the usual mishaps during shipping.In response of the obvious question about why write this much about a chair that is too small for me: My participation in the Vine program obligates me to write reviews of the products I receive.-- Douglas B.

Some of them are quite handy... things most people use quite often. But there are others which will only be useful to those who have a specialized need for them. This laminator is one of those in my opinion. If you wish to laminate paper items which will be handled by many people such as menus or perhaps, flash cards used by children... lamination may be a nice solution as it allows you to clean things up nicely after each use. Many items that used to be laminated to save in archives are now simply scanned into your computer and can even be enhanced greatly once digitized. If an original is precious, then simple lamination is not the way to go at all... preservation of originals considered precious is an art in itself...lamination is almost never recommended for that. This device is a simple and limited tool. Limited to mainly 3 mil material. If you are thinking place mats I think you need to find one more heavy duty. I had no problems with the function of the unit. So if it is right for you with its limitations I can recommend it.', 'I\\'ve had the HP L7680 for slightly over three months.  I\\'ve been a pretty heavy user, having printed (according to the self-test page) almost 4000 pages during that time.  Unlike some of the others mentioned here, my unit has been completely reliable.Print Quality - Printing is very sharp and closely approaches laser quality...it\\'s certainly above the threshold for business correspondence and presentations.  The color output is solid, with almost no visible banding.  I have not used it to print many photos, but those that I have have been also acceptable, given the constraints of a four color ink system.  If photography printing is your primary usage, you should buy a printer with more ink colors.Ink consumption - Over the span of 4000 pages, I went through the initial set of ink cartridges and am now on the third black cartridge...the second cartridge was a standard capacity one, while the third is the XL version.  It\\'s still 2/3 full.  A second set of color cartridges were also the standard capacity versions.  They\\'re still 3/4 full.  When they go empty, they\\'ll also be replaced with the XL versions.  Most of my printing is obviously black with a minor amount of spot color.Faxing - It works.  Faxes seem to get there.Copying - The internal memory is inadequate to allow more than 5-6 pages of a document to be scanned and stored for collated printing.  This flaw was obviously anticipated by the printer\\'s firmware designers...the pagethat causes the memory to overflow is returned to the scanning input tray so it can be scanned in the next five page batch.  Unfortunately this flaw requires manual intervention...you have to remove the five printed pages from the output tray, set them aside and then place them on top of the next batch out.  This is an absolute pain...The leader of the copier design team should be required to make fifteen copies of Tolstoy\\'s War and Peace as atonement.Scanning - The HP software works, but is awkward.  I have yet to discover where the defaults are set...and the preset ones aren\\'t optimal for my office.  I\\'d like to be able to set it to scan an 8x11.5 letter size by default, rather than have the software guess the paper size based upon the image.  It\\'s NEVER guessed correctly.  And, after scanning something into Adobe Acrobat, I need to click on \"cancel\" three more times before the image is finally transferred...it\\'s like a Japanese monster movie...The Software That Wouldn\\'t Die.  There\\'s other annoyances.  The bottom line, though, is that it works.  It\\'s just doesn\\'t work nicely.So...the copying and scanning issues dropped this printer from a strong five stars down to three.  It prints great and if there was a socket where I could add in more memory, the copying problem would go away.  But there isn\\'t.  And while the scanning stuff is just annoying, the copying problem is a real time-waster.Update:  Since I\\'ve had the printer for a year and a half, I thought I\\'d add in a quick update and note that it\\'s still going strong.  I\\'ve gone through 500cc of black ink, 50-60cc of cyan and yellow, and 36cc of magenta.  There has been some drift in the alignment, resulting in some slight banding while printing, but I suspect that that could be calibrated out.  The only major problem has been wear in the automatic page feed mechanism in the document feeder, which causes misfeeds while faxing or copying.  Cleaning the rollers and pads helped, but they should be replaced.  The purchase of a high speed scanner (Fujitsu ScanSnap S510 Sheet-fed Scanner) has pretty much eliminated my use of the automatic document feeder, otherwise this problem would be a serious hassle.Update - 6/20/11 -  The price of ink cartridges for this printer has climbed to insane heights.  While it used to be fairly economical to use, it\\'s now too expensive to keep.  Although it bothers me to scrap something that\\'s still printing beautifully, out it goes...', \"For the past few years, I have used Epson 2200 (first), Epson 1400, and an Epson 260 printers.  Initially, they were good printers.  Once I started to replace ink cartridges the $$$ began to flow.  Between cleaning the print heads almost constantly and doing repeated nozzle checks, I had to think there must be some other way.  I finally did have one of my 2200's serviced and the cost was about half what the printer cost; plus the nearest authorized service center is in a neighboring state (75 miles). And it didn't take long before I was back to square one on that particular printer.  I put it on the street next to the garbage can and nobody even tried to pick it up.  So I put it IN the can. The print heads are difficult to clean; require constant attention, and the ink is prohibitively expensive, if you purchase genuine Epson cartridges.  Third party inks work, but sources change and so does the formulation apparently of the ink. This only adds to the cleaning problems.  While they are working, Epson printers are great.  I fiddled with them for almost 6 years. No more; purchased a pair of Canon printers.  I had owned a Canon I9900 that I gave away when I decided to switch over to Epson. Ironically, the I9900 is now on its third owner and is still in service.  So much for Epson.  And their Technical Support is flawed as well, unless you can work directly with the FAQ section of their website.  But if your question isn't on there, good luck.\", \"I received this item for free through Amazon vine.  I played with it for a while and then gave it to my 7-year daughter for her reaction.  My initial reaction was that the product was fairly decent.  It functions very well as a portable dictionary and spelling device.  It looks like a children's toy, and given the colors and design, was clearly intended for children.  When I first opened the package, I assumed it was priced in the $20.00 price range, and it appears to be a good value if sold at that price.  Then I went to Amazon's web-site and found that it sells for almost $60.00, and my initial reaction changed considerably.I don't know why anyone would pay $60.00 for this product.  The build quality is very flimsy.  When removing it from the packaging, my wife actually dislodged the cover, and it was somewhat difficult to put back on.It comes with several spelling games, which would be very useful for kids learning to spell, but only if the voice quality was clear enough to understand.  Unfortunately, the voice quality is very mechanical and it is often difficult to understand what it has said.  That makes playing the spelling games very frustrating.In short, if you need a portable dictionary and spell corrector and don't have access to the internet, and you can find this for about $20.00, I'd buy it.  At $60.00, it's hard to imagine why anyone would.  In fact, this very same manufacturer (Franklin) makes other similar products that are more stylish that you can buy on Amazon.com for under $40 (today at least).  I don't see any reason why this product should command a premium over those products.  If anything, this product should be cheaper.\", \"The item description doesn't mention the paper's weight, but I'll fill you in: there isn't very much to it. The only thing adding to the cost and weight is the reinforced holes on the edge of the sheet. Otherwise, they're borderline copy paper thickness (but just a hair thicker). The reason I'm such a picky pain in the behind about paper is because I am really into paper, ink, and the rest. I generally buy heavier weight paper for my own needs, such as taking notes in class and the like, because I like for the paper to take the ink from the fountain pens that I use for writing, without bleeding all over the pages behind it, or feathering all over the page.What I do love for heavier paper isHammermill Laser Print Paper - 8 1/2'' x 11'' Letter Size - White - 24# - 98 Brightness - 500 sheet Reamlb. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the grid lines like this graph paper does. If you don't mind spending more money on really nice, archival, acid-free paper that's going to cost a bit more, search for theRhodia Wirebound Notebook 9X11.75 Black Grid. It'll get the job done on very pleasant to write on paper, and it's heavy enough to use both sides.EDIT: Tried the paper again with a medium nib, and ink that does behave on a wider variety of paper. No feathering at all, very little bleed through. Works fine with an italic nib, a medium sized European and Japanese nib, and a broad nib from a Pelikan pen. Works just fine with mechanical pencil, although the lines don't show up very clearly, because the paper isn't a bright white. If you have a nice enough pencil, it will certainly show up clearly though.I modified my rating, because although the paper doesn't feel very heavy at all, it's certainly of a higher quality than your run-of-the-mill cheapo graphing paper you get in the typical notebooks. It's a WHOLE LOT cheaper than the Rhodia paper, and you can put it into your own binder if you want. Definitely a good buy if you need nicer paper to archive your school notes for the next semester.\", 'Great pad for putting under washer feet to keep washer from vibrating around great price would highly recommend but no for a mouse pad!', 'Honestly, I ordered these from Vine by mistake.

Of course, you don\\'t need medical precision to laminate a recipe, but for the anal retentive person (like me) it just didn\\'t look and feel how I wanted it to.

Besides not overloading your shredder's capabilities or shredding material that you shouldn't, the next best thing you can do to protect your investment is to regularly lubricate the cutters.  This reduces wear, noise, and can prevent the teeth from breaking.Be sure to read the instructions for your particular shredder, however, about the type of oil to use and the frequency.  You may be tempted to use other types of oil you already have around your house or WD-40 or something, but many of those things are flammable and will only serve to damage your shredder or worse.As another reviewer said, be careful when cutting the tip on the bottle because if you make it too big, the oil will be harder to control.\", '.I checked out Epson\\'s WF-M1030, the base version of this printer.Good news...\"Up to 60% less printing costs than mono laser printers\"Bad news...that\\'s if you\\'re one of 3 people in the world who pay full list price for your laser cartridges and drums.

If you touch the labels immediately after printing they will be ruined.  Even after allowing the labels to sit for 30 minutes touching a moist finger to the label will smear it severely.

It just arrived yesterday, ordered two days prior, God love Prime!  I had another one for years, which I somehow misplaced.  Its flexibility makes it more than just a medium-sized book holder.  On the surface, it seems to be good only for your average NASB-sized hardback Bible (about an inch thick).  So the rest of this review is about how ELSE you use this thing.Right now, as I type, I\\'ve got the left \\'hook\\' hanging over my flat-panel monitor.  So the thing is hanging by that left hook, diagonally (askew), and upside down.  The back long \\'legs\\' are folded out, so think of the thing as in standing position.. but upside down.  A plastic clamp (could use even a big paper clip) holds a bunch of papers together, for input (about 10).  So this \\'sturdy stand\\' also acts like a monitor clamp at eye-level, without the adhesive and flimsy plastic holders which so easily break.  The stand\\'s rubber feet protect the metal ends from harming the monitor; frankly, the one hanging off the monitor isn\\'t even touching the screen.  So two vital uses, not just one.You can also use the thing to prop up large/heavy books.  Or, to hold any size book yet allow you to turn the pages.  So, now it props up my huge Shakespeare book (about 2\" thick?),  also here in Amazon, by Royal Shakespeare Company.  Or, ponderous short 3-inch (maybe 2+?) notebooks.  You just use the stand differently.  [A European style X-shaped dish rack, especially wood, is also useful.]  How?  Again, upside down.  I put the Shakespeare book on a mat, turned the \\'sturdy stand\\' upside down and turned the back legs TOWARD each other.  Could use a rubber-like place mat, if reading from a table.  Something to give more traction for a heavy book.  Much better than your typical book holder, because it tilts backwards, and the upside down \\'hooks\\' add support.Okay, so now suppose you don\\'t need to read a book. You can fold the thing sideways and store it just about anywhere.. or, you can HANG it, using the forward \\'hooks\\' for clothing, accessories, you-name-it.That\\'s a lot of sturdy value, for five bucks.

My bad!', 'Based on the description, I thought this tape was for security -- the type that when lifted up off its sealed surface, left behind part of the printing and in doing so, provided clear evidence of tampering. Rather, the tape is simply communicating a public service message to check the seal before accepting the package.The tape has a double whammy. It is too thin to safely use for shipping, so it is not the best choice for packing tape, and further, it does not do the job suggested by its stated message. Since it is easy to lift the tape up and put it back down without it being evident, a package recipient may glance at the tape see nothing obvious, assume no tampering and accept the shipment. The product, at best, accomplishes little, and at worst is counter-productive. Misleading and pointless.', \"**UPDATE- Originally I gave this little guy 4 stars. But then, I got a wrinkle in between the two sheets of laminating film and now I can't get it to run smoothly. I am contacting customer support because I have wasted a ton of film trying to get it wrinkle-free again. I think the wrinkle happened when I removed a picture that was very slightly stuck to the film already and I wanted to readjust it. Anyway, once the wrinkle began, it wouldn't stop. The replacement cartridges are too expensive to waste the way this one is being wasted trying to fix this issue. So if you buy this laminator, be VERY careful if you try to pull something back out of it that you already started to put in. Literally, I had barely put it in, I didn't pull very hard either.***Further Update : have stopped using this machine altogether. It repeatedly ruined documents and photos and I decided just not worth all of the effort for the lousy output.\", 'A nice-looking, well-built printer is easy to use, with a high-quality scan/copy function, but it stumbles on installation issues and falls down entirely on inkjet problems.The new just-unpackaged cartridges printed fine at first, but when I got back to the printer a few days later, the black was splotchy, and all my efforts wouldn\\'t make this nearly-new cartridge print correctly again (cleaning, re-seating, test page after test page, recalibrating and realigning repeatedly, etc).Oddly enough, what must be a frequent issue was nowhere to be found on the Lexmark support site FAQ, and I had to email support to ask what to do.  To Lexmark\\'s credit, they replied with directions within a matter of hours, directing me to a \"Deep Clean\" option from the printer\\'s console (oddly, not found in the software), which finally corrected the problem.  A rather offputting introduction to inkjet printers!Print quality on plain paper (multipurpose 20lb that I also use for laser) is acceptable, but nothing special.  Solid areas of ink look \"wet\" and the paper wrinkles a bit until fully dry, and even then doesn\\'t look entirely flat.  Worse, the colored inks run easily.  A single droplet of water from an errant drink causes the color to smear and run (especially cyan and magenta, but somewhat the yellow also).  Far from archival quality-- it might be better on specialty paper, but who wants to use fancy paper for everyday printing?The print heads move with some considerable force-- the table this printer sits on vibrates and shakes while the printer is going.  It\\'s a low-end IKEA table, but I was surprised by how much side-to-side momentum the printhead uses.  It makes me miss my old, much quieter color-laser printer.All this is beside the fact that inkjet printing costs much more per-page than laser.  If it worked particularly well (as it does in my Canon photo printer), then it\\'s worth the higher cost, but in the Lexmark, inkjet is the worst of both worlds-- expensive and low-quality.I\\'ve traditionally used laser-printers or photo-printers, so I\\'m not sure if these problems are common to inkjets, or just to Lexmark ink.  Either way, it\\'s offputting.  \"Colorfast\" seems like a basic requirement to me.The printer lacks a quick-setup guide and instead uses a combination of a prompted install process on the PC combined with directions on the printer\\'s LCD.  Unfortunately what should have beeen easy-to-follow missed basic steps such as going back to actually add the printer (to windows) once the initial configuration was completed (which included physical setup but left the printer unusable from within Windows).  Installers are basic, all major vendors should just get this right-- isn\\'t that what Quality Assurance is for?  Wifi setup can\\'t be done from the printer, and has to be done from win/mac over USB.  That\\'s a contrast from other functions that can only be done from the printer\\'s panel.The update option from inside the software failed (no meaningful error), and the support links from the software went to dead Lexmark pages (tried the software from the install disc as well as updated from website).  The latter usually implies a website redesign that didn\\'t correctly redirect support URLs to allow for existing software versions.  It\\'s not a big deal in the world of Google search, but implies a degree of sloppiness-- this printer has only been around for a year or so??  And it makes the all-in-one portal program pretty useless-- why even have the portal be a windows program, rather than just a shortcut to an up-to-date portal page that is printer specific, or an in-printer webpage?The printer is sturdy, and feels well-made (heavy lid, solid plastic, etc) other than aforementioned \"printhead jerks the printer around\" issue.  It has an auto sleep mode and wakes up from \"sleep\" very rapidly on access.As far as support goes, a printer firmware upgrade worked flawlessly over wireless, a nice unexpected touch (didn\\'t need to reconnect to USB).  So good firmware updating and email response, the rest leaves something to be desired.This unit is a much better scanner/copier than it is a printer.  It scans faster than my 4 year old mid-range HP flatbed scanner, with sharper, crisper output.  Scan and copy of a color image is fast.  The \"send to PC\" option worked surprisingly flawlessly, no interaction needed, it kicks off a scan import dialogue on the PC.  Graphics scanned as a PDF looked low-quality, but scanned as a photograph they looked very good.  Some scan options are available only on the printer\\'s console, rather than in-software-- it would be nice if they were available in both places.I did not test fax, an obsolete technology I try to ignore.  All of this was on a PC running a current Windows7 SP1.Quirks aside, it\\'s the inkjet behavior and problems that make this Not Recommended, although I like the design, and it\\'s a very decent scanner.  For an all-in-one, I\\'d look for a laser model instead.', \"Didnt get the XL just the reg one to save some cash, and in the end printed about 4 8x10's and it was empty, so I end up spending way more to get another XL which I should have in the 1st place.

Then consider the wrist rest takes up two inches, leaving less than seven inches of space to work with. My hand, from where the wrist bends to the end of my middle finger is eight inches in length so my hand hangs over the mousepad slightly, and so does the mouse.To give you additional perspective, I use anEvoluentand Logitech MX Revolution mouse.  Placed side by side, the two mice barely fit the width of the pad.  Moving the cursor upward is not only slightly uncomfortable because my fingers hang over the edge, but the dropoff will cause my cursor to track incorrectly.

Still, only small hands need apply.', 'If you want to cut large pieces of paper straight, this is a great choice for home. It works just like the big heavy-duty paper cutters at the elementary schools. You lift up the arm with the sharp blade, slide the paper where you want it and bring the arm down to cut. It&#8217;s got marks to measure any length up to 15 inches and provides a nice, straight cut.For the most part, it works very well for me. I tried to cut eight pages of 22 pound regular copy paper and found that was too much. The middle of the blade got stuck, or wouldn&#8217;t easily cut. I found six pages worked better. This unit is light-weight and easy to move around. It works best on a sturdy surface like a table or counter. The only thing I don&#8217;t like about it is that it won&#8217;t fit in the box when fully assembled. It came with the handle not attached to the cutting arm. It popped on easily, but to store it in the closed box, I would have to remove the handle. I don&#8217;t want the handle to get loose over time from being removed and put back on, so I store it with the end of the box open and hope not too much dust gets in.', \"Love these protective cases.

Not to mention the cleanup. So these pencils appealed immediately when I found them, offering a much more mess-free way to allow my kids to indulge in their love for painting.The set offers a nice array of colors, and they work beautifully as colored pencils. My son and I used them for a preschool project, and he and I both colored with them on separate occasions. The school project was on regular white paper, so brushing the design with water didn't work all that well. The colors were also a great deal more muted as watercolors than they were as colored pencils. It didn't spread much before the paper started to bubble, so we had to leave it half colored pencil half faint watercolor. I was disappointed in the results.I later gave the pencils another shot, this time using textured watercolor paper, and got better results. While the colors still didn't spread all that evenly, I did get more of a watercolor effect, and the paper was able to stand up to the addition of water.The colors also seemed more vibrant than they had with the regular paper.Granted, watercolors in general provide more muted tones, but what disappointed me with these is the way their reaction to water is kind of hit or miss. I didn't notice if specific colors seemed more apt to spread than others, but the end result has always been pretty uneven. These aren't exactly a substitute for a good old watercolor set, but they do offer a more no muss, no fuss option for painting, and they inspired me to look for various alternatives. If you'd like a good pencil set, these will work, and while they're not terrible as paints, I think you're better off looking at other options.\", \"This is a flat piece of folded thin cardboard which stores and dispenses a few Post-it notes.

Upon taking the tip off and the grip there is plastic threads and plastic barrel underneath a metal \"skin\". Pretty much a metal veneer of sorts all along this pencil. I would think metal on plastic threads would not tend to hold up for a long length of time. My conclusion is this pencil while looking quite nice on the exterior, the quality and durability of basically plastic guts just will not stand the test of time. I see Pentel selling lots of these due to the durability issues, sadly another company that has always made products I have used and liked over the years has stepped quality down a notch. The design of plastic plastic threading/click mechanism being used against metal just defies common sense to me. They should have went the step further and maybe charged a buck or two more for a far superior product.', 'From the picture of the product you can see that these drawers are designed to stack upon each other. They do, but if the contents are heavy you\\'ll find the bottom of the box bows a bit and it makes it tough to open the drawer underneath. You will also find the top drawer is a bit unstable if the drawers under it are lighter.Those are the negatives.The positives? Well, I\\'m a banker box junkie. I use them for all sorts of things from storing (files, books, clothing, papers), sorting (childrens clothes, odds and ends, books etc), and packing. These boxes are heavy duty file drawers. If you like banker boxes you know some of the cheaper ones are, well cheap! They fall apart easily and sometimes if the contents are heavy you can pick them up by the handles and have the handle tear. I don\\'t think there is any chance of this happening with these boxes.My main reason for choosing these boxes was the need for an inexpensive filing system for the myriad of paper that seems to follow and grow as one ages. In the bottom boxes I have put all my tax returns and supporting documentation for some forty years. You know--you most likely will never ever need it, but if you do, you want it handy! In the next tier I put letters, email copies, art work and the like from kids and grandchildren. I want to keep it, but don\\'t have room for it scattered all over the house. In the next set of drawers I put things that I want to keep, but have no place in the house--like some of my son\\'s first shoes, clothing and toys. Some things from my parents house that they got from relatives and stored--you don\\'t need it, but throwing it out seems like a sacrilege. The top boxes are my \"throw away\" boxes. Paperwork and things that if not used in \"X\" months or a year or two -- can be thrown out.I put the boxes on three wooden boards in the basement to keep them off the floor. It took awhile to consolidate everything in some sort of order, but now my drawers and cupboards are clutter free!', 'The software for the labelwriter is truly awful and some of it damages other applications.  If you use Microsoft Word with other applications that share startup manipulation of the Tools menu, you will find that the DYMO startup file, DYMOWordAddin.dot, will destroy all the other starup commands of applications such as Adobe pdfwriter, Endnote, and others.  These applications will no longer appear in the menu, but the DYMO application will.  This is doubly insulting because the DYMO addon is itself dysfunctional.  The only safe way to create labels is to use the DYMO label application, which works reasonably well, although it too is unable to position graphics and writing with the necessary flexibility.If you run into problems after installation, find the word startup folder and remove any addins with DYMO in them.  This is a cross platform problem that involves Win XP and Mac OSX.  Once the DYMO files are removed, Word returns to proper function.The software is terrible, but the hardware is excellent.  Although the labels are rather expensive, the printing is clear and crisp and one has access to all of the fonts on your computer.  If is hoped that DYMO will put a greater effort into the software in the future so that their total product is as good as the hardware they sell.', \"These dividers are pretty and will add pizazz to a binder- if you can get them in.

The cardboard sleeves themselves have somewhat garish graphic patterns in bright colors on them -- I doubt you\\'ll be wanting to spoil the appearance of your brand new sleek and stylish MacBook Pro or Sony Vaio laptop with these anytime soon.The real kicker is what a poor value these dispensers are. Original Post-It notes cost about six dollars per 1,200 sheets. These \"laptop Post-Its\" can be purchased for about three dollars for 60 sheets. Therefore, the \"Laptop Note Dispensers\" are a whopping 10 times more expensive per sheet than conventional Post-It notes.Your needs may differ to mine, but I honestly never found it a problem throwing the 3-inch square original pads in my laptop case along with my laptop and just having them to hand when I needed them.

This notebook is very durable and stands up to a decent amount of travel in my bag.  The perforated pages tear cleanly with a fold on the perforation, but will not tear out with daily use.  The only complaint is the thin pages.  If you highlight with darker highlighters or use a heavy writing pen, you'll probably only want to take notes on one side of the page.  With a good brighter highlighter, both sides is fine.  Bleed through isn't the problem so much as just seeing through the page.\", \"I just tried one of these cartridges in my new printer, and it gummed up the works.

The paper is much thicker than the cheaper graph paper and they uphold very well through erasing, writing with pencil, and everyday school wear and tear.  Because the papers are reinforced at the hole punch area, the papers are also less likely to rip.  The reinforcement is like a strip of tape down the side of the hole punched area.  The only thing I'm not terribly fond of is the &#34;Five Star&#34; logo printed down the margins of the paper.  It's not a big issue as I don't write in the margins often anyways, but they're there and a blatant pitch for buying five star products.

None of the other equipment, including the printer that this one replaced, ever drew so much power that it knocked the APC Uninterrupted Power Supply offline every time.

I have never felt any need to attach them directly to my laptop or desktop tower.3. I find it easier to peel off individual post-its when they are not in this dispenser.4. Given the limited amount of post-its in a dispenser, this is not economical for heavy use compared to the price of buying post-its without a dispenser.5. If you want to stick a post-it pad to a surface, you can easily do so by using the Scotch Removable Restickable Glue Stick.

I just prefer the pen to glide with little resistance.I definitely like the smoothness of the Fine [.7] and Bold [1.0] versions.

So in the end I just stuck some 3M Command Hooks on the wall and hung the bulletin board from that, and it worked great.  Probably not the most secure mounting method, but if/when it falls I&#8217;ll think about using those monster brackets and screws. (Note: The board weights a little under 5 lbs so I used two 3lb Command Hooks to secure it to the wall.)As for the Quartet Cork Board itself, it is high materials and quality construction.  The gray and black color of the plastic frame is neutral and very business-like.  The cork itself is about average thickness.  You can push the pin all the way through the cork, but because of the thickness of the frame the pins won&#8217;t go into the wall.  The self-healing ability of the cork is very nice, but will only work with the thinner pins.So overall this is a very nice cork board for the price.

Didn\\'t happen. They all came out as one document no matter what mode I was in. STRIKE THREE. YER OUT, EPSON.After getting my return label and dropping it off at UPS I hooked my old Canon back up, put 8 cards on the scanner and got 8 separate jpegs. I profusely apologized to my Canon and we have reconciled.PS: Canon has toll free tech support.', \"These are just OK.  They don't seem to work any better than the off-brand ones I can get at the Dollar Tree for - yep - a dollar for a 2-pack.  I still had trouble getting some colors off the whiteboard.

They are thicker than some other sheet protectors I have used and are sturdy which hopefully means they will hold up well with long-term use. The color is more opaque than I would have liked, but I think this has to do with the fact that they are non-glare sheet protectors. If you are working under the glare of light or even from the sun, the non-glare feature will make it easier to read the material contained within these sheet protectors. The dimensions on the sheets are 8.5-x-11-inches, and I purchased a box of 200 which turned out to be much cheaper than if I had bought it at a local retail store.', \"Scotch brand of tape is an oldie but goody, and its gift wrap tape is no different.

The installation even feels older. That said, it scans OK and the software bundle includes the excellent Omnipage Professional 15 and the venerable Paperport 11.Pros:Nice bundle with scanner hardware, drivers, OCR software (Omnipage Pro 15) and organizer software (Paperport 11). These appear to be full versions and work in their function.Good price for the bundle.The scanner is fast enough that it isn\\'t an issue for a few pages (seemed like &lt;10 seconds for a full page at 300dpi).The scanner is quiet and does not seem any more noisy than the other sheetfeed scanners I have (Fujitsu ScanSnap, Brother 8660DN). Very tolerable.The size of the scanner is small and does not take up a lot of desk space, for the scanner itself.There are two settings for the output side of the scanner so that it can accommodate both thin and thick paper.Cons:Installation process is from Hell, or perhaps 1995. Probably in between as it uses the net, poorly.** Don\\'t bother with the Nuance registration, which is a lot of the problem. Just register later or send in the form USPS if you must. The online process is a mess.For some reason, they needed two disks for the install; perhaps they used CDs.The scanner unit is small, but the cable is HUGE. It is supposed to be USB, but it is a special Y cable that has a connection to the power brick integrated into it and a proprietary connector on the scanner side. The cable is about the thickness of most VGA  cables.The software has amazing issues such as making the default scan size 8.5\" x 14\" which is US Legal pad. It apparently cannot be set to default to US Letter. Stupid, just plain stupid.Scan quality is just OK. Good enough to make the OCR work.Summary:This is less for less. Get something else that speaks Mac as well as PC. There are a lot of choices in this price range. In the bargain, you can get software from this decade, too. Most of the copyrights for this software included are in the mid 2000\\'s.', \"Okay, this is a great calculator for science and math students, but I needed a new calculator to replace my old regular one.Well, I was given the product from Vine to review and it DOES NOT process percentages right, guess I'll just get a cheapie basic calculator, thats all this guy basic guy needs\", 'I\\'ve been a fan of Avery labels for years. Given the choice between Avery and store brand, I almost always choose Avery. This time it\\'s different. On several fronts the Avery 16154 ticket stock fails.This ticket stock became available and a good time, because I was preparing to print tickets for an upcoming event. The ticket stock I usually use is four across, while these are five across. That meant I had to redesign the tickets in order to use these tickets. The obvious difference here would be smaller graphics and smaller fonts, or less information, with the Avery 16154.Personal Information RequiredAs with any Avery label, to properly use this ticket stock you need a template for Word, WordPerfect, or some other software like InDesign. Since this is a new \"label,\" templates are not automatically built into the software packages yet. Not to worry, you can just go to Avery\\'s website and use their online design page to design your ticket or you can download a free template for Word.In order to use either of these options, you must provide them with your first and last name, as well as your email address. Had I paid for these labels, and found out that I needed to provide personal information to Avery just to be able to use them, they would have been returned for a refund. However, since I needed to properly evaluate this ticket stock, I \"took one for the team\" and provided this information. I then proceeded to design tickets using both the Word template and the online service.Using the Word TemplateThe Word template is laid out in a table, and as such has all limitations of working with tables in Word. First of all, to do anything useful you have to undo a lot of Avery\\'s hard work. Avery\\'s predefined styles waste so much space that you can hardly fit any information on the ticket, especially the stub. So the first thing you have to do is modify Avery\\'s styles. If you plan on using any graphics on your ticket you are apt to be frustrated by the way Word handles graphics in tables. (No penalty to Avery for that.) The other restriction with designing the tickets using the template is you cannot sequentially number the tickets unless you do them manually. If you want to have numbered tickets, designing them online is your only choice.You also have to take into account minimum printer margins. When you factor this in, the actual allowable print area is quite small. My laser printer has a minimum margin of 3/16 inch all around, so I lost 3/8 of an inch of width from a ticket that is only 1 3/4 inches wide.Designing OnlineAfter washing out with Word, it seems like using the online service is the way to go. Using this method to design your tickets is a bit of a kludge, but it gets the job done. The fonts are somewhat limited but you can probably find a font that suits your style. You can use one of Avery graphics or import graphics from your computer into Avery\\'s program. (Since I was using my own graphics I can\\'t comment on the availability or quality of Avery\\'s.) Overall, it seems like a good idea. When you complete your project you can either save it on their site or on your own computer. Even if you save the project to your computer you still have to go back online before you can print it. When you go to print, Avery converts the file to a PDF from which you print. When Avery converted my tickets to PDF it compressed my text boxes so they overlapped and the resulting tickets are unusable.In the end I gave up on these tickets and went back and used the stock I used previously.Bottom LineThe ticket stock itself is up to Avery\\'s usual high standards. It feeds easily through my laser printer and has smooth perforations. But none of this matters if you can\\'t design and print the tickets. And this is where Avery fails.', 'These labels are excellent -- 100% clear.PROS:--Sticky but easily removable--Labels are lightweight and thin--Labels look sleek/high qualityCONS:--Labels are a bit delicate--Price is highIf you are in need of clear labels, these are a great option!', \"This college rules graph paper is filler paper, meaning it can be inserted into a three ring binder. Each sheet has a reinforced strip on it to prevent it ripping out of the binder. The thickness of the paper is adequate and as I expected. The lines on the paper are perfectly consistent throughout the package and they are dark enough. This graph paper is double sided and has different size graph lines on the front and back. On the front one square inch of paper contains 16 squares and on the back one square inch of paper contains 20 squares on it. Overall the price is a little high for only 100 sheets but you get both sides of the paper so it's like getting 200 sheets of cheaper single side graph paper. This is very good paper and we like it a lot.\", \"I bought the 6180DW because Brother's entry level printer was very expensive to operate. This printer's per page costs are much lower, so the total cost of ownership is also lower than most other Brother printers.I've run into two issues however, each costing one star. Both apply to Macs.The printer is often unresponsive. It has an aggressive power-save sleep cycle and a defect in its Mac drivers. That means it doesn't wake from sleep when it should. One has to press the 'Go' button to awaken it. (We use a wired ethernet connection to the network.)I thought a firmware update might help, but on a Mac this requires Java. Java is no longer a part of OS X, and it's an awkward installation with attendant security issues. Brother should support firmware updates through the printer's admin web GUI.Update: These days we have to press the Go button every time we want it to print. It doesn't 'sleep', it goes into a coma! There's something deeply wrong with the OS X drivers and the problem is not improving. Sadly, I now recommend Mac users avoid all Brother printers.\", 'These are a great tool for organizationally challenged students who tend to lose or misplace loose papers, but the truth is I use them too. They are sturdy, they can hold a surprising amount paper, and they add a splash of color to otherwise boring binders.', \"There was a time when the name Wilson Jones stood for good quality. Having recently reviewed a different Wilson Jones binder and now this one, I think that reputation for quality is a thing of the past.I was quite excited about receiving this binder, as the idea of the &#34;cut and sewn&#34; cover made it sound as though it would be covered with heavy material. It is not. The vinyl cover is thin and on the binder I received, it doesn't fit tightly over the chipboard covers. The result is a wavy finish that looks. . . cheap.When you run your hand over the cover, it feels plasticky. Again, cheap. At almost $20, it is not cheap to buy. Were I buying it, I wouldn't pay over $5, and I might not pay that.The problems don't end when you open the covers. This inside coverings are so tightly adhered to the chipboard covers that I could barely insert a sheet of ordinary copy or typing paper. The three ring binder apparatus appears to be the same quality you would find in a one dollar binder from the dollar store. It doesn't feel substantial or reliable. My binder had strips of cardboard protruding from each side of the binder rings. My first though was they were there to protect the cover from the rings pressing into them (and they may be) but as they don't remove, I now think they are meant to be paper lifters, to keep the paper from settling below the rings and tearing. This would be thoughtful and useful it they were sturdy plastic instead of lightweight cardboard. They too look cheap.All in all this is a greatly overpriced product manufactured with poor quality control and cheap products. Very disappointing.\", 'As Scotch/3M says in their own review:\"Scotch Tear-By-Hand Tape is the ultimate in convenience, because no scissors or dispensers are needed for use. This clever tape tears straight and easily--with just your hands--yet it seals securely.

After trying this tape, while I still feel more secure with a heavier packaging tape, I believe this would be a very good (but also very expensive) alternative to pay for that convenience.  I buy Scotch packaging tape in 6-roll packages when it is on sale (and it IS my go-to favorite), and I would buy this only if I got the same value (quantity of tape) for my money.As Scotch itself is wise to say in that last sentence above, \"... for your GENERAL mailing, shipping and moving needs.\"  I would NOT use this tape for heavier packages in ANY of those circumstances (especially moving), but for small to medium-size bubble envelopes and packages up to a few pounds (3 or 4 at the most), I would use this tape and have to admit being able to tear the quantity you need by hand IS a pretty cool convenience.', \"Two features set this quadrille paper apart from the norm, readily available in big box stores.

The shredder is three years old now and operates as well as new. The motor sounds even it chews through the papers very well.The bottle is easy to open and a long extension nozzle is helpful for precise place-ment of the drops. Each application requires only a small amount of oil. I would say I put a total of 8 drops in the opening, and then move the blades in both directions.  This takes a total of many 20 seconds.I read that once this oil runs out it can be replaced by vegetable oil and I will try that, however this is not going to happen any time soon as I use very little during each application, so this bottle is going to last a very long time.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates.

I've been using spiral notebooks for years and this item I received looks like it may live up to the hype.First of all the cover surprised me. It does appear to be water resistant, but it is also much stronger than the usual covers, especially the solid back cover. Twice I poured a couple of tablespoons of water on the front covered and the water did not soak in, but wiped up very easily. Although the covers are available in several colors, the one I received is white and has a slick, clean look about it.Although the description said there were four pockets, there were only two - one double-sided storage pocket in the front. It was folded over in such a way that it looked like two more pockets could be within the fold, but there were none - just the two pockets. The pages were the white college-ruled paper we are used to. I've never seen the storage pockets reinforced like this, but appreciate that they look like they will allow usage without tearing.Finally, the no snag Spiral-lock wire running along the left edge was the strongest I've ever seen in any kind of notebook of this type. I can't imagine this notebook coming apart unless someone deliberately tries, and then they would have to be strong to break it down.All in all, a notebook that looks like it could last for quite some time. Mead seems to have tried to think of everything.

That over 50 year old stapler still works well to this day. The new Commercial stapler from today's Acco/Swingline is, like most manufactured products, built in China to a price and in my view does not deserve the name Commercial. The old stapler has a substantial and attractively art deco styled cast base while the new one makes due with a quickly stamped steel cheaper alternative. The old stapler has a much easier way to switch modes between inward bending and outward bending rear legs. I could go on, but the point is that the modern version is not in any way comparable to its better made predecessor.\", \"It's OK.  I use it.

YOU DON\\'T NEED IT!ORIGINAL REVIEW: Since I purchased this printer I have had to uninstall and re-install it\\'s software 4 times.

I\\'ve learned to live with an assortment  of various \"hacks\" to get this baby to work adequately.The first thing that HP neglects to tell you when you set this up is that it draws too much electricity (or whatever....mojo) to work properly if you plug it directly into one of your computer\\'s empty USB2 ports. The printer requires it\\'s own electrified USB hub....all by itself!The \"hardware\" works just fine. A bit of a quibble with the paper feeder, but basically the printer itself delivers what it promises. It prints well, faxes well, has a legal size flatbed scanner....which is why I chose this model to begin with.My last HP all in one worked just great. I replaced it because HP no longer supported the ink cartridge and the print heads were starting to go and costly to replace.I use Windows XP, I don\\'t know exactly what the HP software glitch is but the scanning program will not function. In order to use the scanner I have to use the adequate scanning program that comes with Windows. I don\\'t bother with HP Photosmart Essential or whatever else came with the printer. Its a nightmare!Every so often, usually when I need to print something right away, the software goes bi-polar and everything crashes. Chaos reigns. Day becomes dark. The only fix is to un-install and then re-install. What causes the glitch? Does HP have any idea? Doubtful!Life is too short and one could go mad over lesser things!UPDATE 8-06-09: Damn thing has crashed for the 5th time! I am tearing my hair out!

I selected it because my CPU has the ventilation on the sides and I needed a unit that didn't cover them up. The stand does not grip the sides,there is no lock mechanism to lock the width so it will hold on to the sides (only the wheels lock). The CPU just balances on the base with no side support.My purpose for getting a stand is not to just raise the CPU off the floor, but to be able to move it back and forth under the desk when I need to check a connection.My previous metal stands made by Fellowes worked this way, but the high sides covered up the ventilation holes on this particular computer.Since this is just a suspension device that doesn't really hold on to the unit, I feel uncomfortable putting my CPU on this unit and hope it doesn't fall off.\", \"I like the clean edge cards.

I'm a few inches above average height for a woman, so normally I'd have to sit with my knees bent back, my feet resting on the chair's lower ring. This isn't the best position to sit in for long hours. It's tiring on your legs, and on your back. The newspaper where I worked used to have foot rests like these, and while they're great for your posture and allowing you to sit more comfortably, oh, how I remember the pain of banging your ankle on the heavy metal corners of one of these things! It hurts like the dickens!But it does solve a big problem some workers have, the problem of chairs that are just too high up for your legs to comfortably sit on the floor. This foot rest is wide, just like I remember the ones from my old job. That gives you a large surface area for your feet. It's very heavy, and there are grip pads at the bottom and top to prevent slipping. This thing is very unlikely to budge on its own. There are basically two heights. The highest one is just right for me when the surface of the foot rest is level to the ground, which leads me to believe this wouldn't be enough for someone much shorter than me.My other complaint--and not a small one--is that the product I received came with a dent on one side. Steel construction means this thing should be sturdy. It shouldn't come with a dent. I know this didn't happen in shipping, because the box was just fine, and obviously cardboard would dent before steel. My guess is someone was stuck with a dented one, so rather than throw it out, they figured they could used it as a review copy. If that's the case, hopefully if you purchase it, you won't get a dented one. Wish I didn't either.So that's one star off for all those bad memories of bruised ankles, and another star off for sending me a dented product.

You'd think a company called 'Scotch' would think their business model through a little more carefully.Now this packing tape is uber strong, more so than other brands I've so I used less when testing it thus saving lots of cash so I can buy more monkeys. Now it's sticky on one side - but here's the clever bit... it's not sticky on the other side! So your parcel doesn't accrue a whole bunch of unwanted fur balls, hair, other boxes and deck chairs during transit. And so when your package arrives it doesn't look like a Katamari Damacy ball.

I buy 99% of my stuff from Amazon and this is why.  Products are easy to return. I bought this printer on a whim from Staples.  They get a 1/2 star.

But I bought it to carry a large tacklebox, a cooler, and a bait bucket out onto a 800 ft pier. NOT GOOD. The base is flat, so if or when you try to strap things down with a bungie cord the little plastic hooks make the cart wobbly, not sitting flat. The only way to use this cart successfully is like you see in the pic, flat items NOT strapped to the bottom plate, otherwise you in for trouble.Anyways, I sent it back. Got a full refund, no questions asked. Hope this review helps some other fisherman.\", 'Avery has designed a sticky note line with some innovative ideas.  The idea behind the Lay Flat Sticky Notes was a good one.  Though I have never felt that standard sticky notes needed improvement, I can see where someone might want a note that lays flatter while they write, and does not have the paper curl up on the ends in the process.  The solution of adding a second strip was a good idea, it\\'s just that it did not translate well in the product development phase of the item Avery produced.I use sticky notes every day at my job, and I actually have some notes on my computer screen that have been there for over a year.  The ends lay as flat as the day I put them there.  So you would think the extra adhesive strip that Avery added would just be a bonus feature to keep their sticky notes flat and in place.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  I stuck the Avery sticky notes on two different surfaces--one on another sheet of paper, and the other on top of my desk.  The first thing I noticed was that if you remove the sheet from the pad and place it on another surface before you write on it, you get a little \"bulge in the middle of the paper, between the sticky at the top of the note, and the other sticky  placed about 2/3 of the way down that paper.  No big deal, but it already blew the \"lay flat\" claim to these notes.  The bigger issue, however, is the peeling away at the top AND bottom of the note not long after you place it on another surface.  Within a few minutes, the bottom of the note on my desk curled at least 3/4 of an inch off the desk top, and refused to lay flat, no matter how many times I tried to smooth it out.  The top of the sticky is also not doing its job, and rises about 1/4 of an inch off the desk top surface.  I have never had an issue with the standard 3M brand of sticky notes doing this, and there appears to be a defect in the adhesive that was used as the backing to these notes.  The same issue held true for the notes I stuck to other papers, it just was not as prominent in the height it curled off the paper surface.  Unless you tape these down with Scotch tape, you will not have a very adhesive sticky note.On a positive note, the paper itself is of good quality, and most pens wrote well on the paper, with the exception of using a red colored pen on the pink and orange note.  The color of the red pen just did not show up very well on those two paper colors.  Kudos to Avery being involved with the Box Tops for Education initiative.  While I try very hard to support companies that offer Box Tops on their products, this is one item that I can not recommend, and will not buy again.  I will be staying with my standard sticky notes for now.', 'They are really lightweight, and one doesn\\'t sharpen very good. I paid $1.69 for this item, and $6.95 shipping, for a total of $8.64.

You can hear clearly and it has an indicator light when someone else is on the line.  The hold button is a nice feature.  However, the speaker feature is horrible. You can't hear anyone clearly and the caller Id display is horrible to read. You pratically have to be on top of it to see who's calling.  After 2 months I have replaced it because I need something with a good speaker.  I don't recommend it if those negatives are important to you.\", \"Unlike other reviews here, for me the lapinator and mousepad didn't work so well. Used it with a Toshiba Satellite laptop and optical mouse. After about 2 hours, the lapinator was almost HOT to the touch, laptop fan did not run less, laptop itself did not feel cool to the touch. Had better luck with other coolant systems. Maybe Toshibas run hotter than other laptops, so it could be a matter of that particular laptop not being well-suited for the lapinator. I run my new HP Pavillion right on my desk's surface, with no resulting overwarming of the laptop or the desk surface. Possibly, this particular cooling pad works optimally with only certain laptops.\", \"I love these boxes.

Adhesive Quality.  Labels shouldn't come off an envelope (which could result in a dead letter), and they shouldn't come off in the printer (which could result in the need for a new printer).4.  Ease of removing from sheet.  If they are not easy to remove, the label can be easily torn.

I use a Logitech MX 1100 Rechargeable Cordless Laser Mouse and the prospect of needing to recharge less frequently would be very welcome.Alas my mouse wants to be charged every 13 days like clockwork regardless of what mouse pad I am using. I waited to review this product until I had gone through 4 recharging cycles just to be sure it would or would not make a difference.My Logitech MX 1100 is a heavy mouse and the slick surface on the 3M pad makes maneuvering much easier than on a fabric pad, a big plus for the 3M surface.The edges on this pad are slightly curled, that was not a problem on my previous 3M pad. The base surface on this new pad is a harder material than the older one. The curling is slight enough it is not a problem for me. I did get about 4 years of use out of my first pad before the micro-grooved surface started wearing down and the tracking became less precise.The one thing I really don't like about this pad vs. my previous 3M pad is the vinyl covered wrist rest. It is harder and less cushioned than the fabric covered one on my previous pad and I don't like the feeling of the vinyl on my wrist, after using for awhile it feels unpleasantly moist and sticky.

I imagine it is a wonderful phone if you get one that works.  Mine refused to ring, and yes I checked the ring setting.  Returned it.', \"Good: 2 layers of cardboard on bottom and each side, 3 on the ends.  Bad: a full file box could be subject to bottom edge blowout on the two layer sides (tested by filling the box, then dropping it not quite straight onto the floor from a foot or two up to simulate rough handling by movers or in a file room, saw small tears form in side panels of box at corners on one end).Good: the lid has flaps that can fold into the handholes on the box, which helps keep the lid on.  Bad: a little difficult to get the locking flaps back out again.Good: box is a single cohesive unit when folded flat, so it will behave well when stored flat.  Bad: the perforated diagonal fold-out flap on the bottom is not as easy or reliable to use in asssembling the box as was intended.  This piece then ends up on the exterior bottom surface of the box, where the perforations can catch while sliding the box on and off shelves/box stacks, and there's also a strange little cutout on one edge of that surface to help allow the folding that can also be a catch/rip point.  Also bad: the long side flaps on these boxes are not cut a little short to account for the assembled position, so you have to crunch the edges a little on the inside of the box to get the flaps in position and they don't lie fully flat.  This also makes disassembly of the box a bit harder, as you have to pry those smashed edges back out.Good: hanging folders hang nicely in the box, and it seems sturdy enough to hold them without crushing too easily.  Bad: you can't put the lid on very well with them in there.Good: dark brown wood-grain and black color helps hide dirt.  Bad: it also limits labeling options with a conventional marker; outside of the lined white space on each end, one would have to use a sticker or something like a silver Sharpie to label a long side or the top.Good: both the lid and the box have flaps covering the raw cardboard edges on the handholes.  Bad: the ends of the tabs/slots for the lid assembly overlap the space for the lid's handhole, so the 3 plies of raw cardboard edges exposed there are irritating to the hands when carrying the box.My primary comparison point for these boxes is a generic Office Depot brand folding cardboard box set that I've used for past moves and occasional storage around the house.  Those boxes cost about half what these do, and are a little lighter weight, but I'm not personally convinced the price difference is worthwhile.  These are overall good boxes; I just wouldn't call them good enough to warrant 5 stars.  I'd feel a lot better about using these for long term file storage than as moving boxes or occasional short term storage.\", \"I ordered these name badges because I thought they might be suitable for more then one kind of project.Yes, you can use them as name badges, and it's nice that you can peel them off the sheet by either the front, for more of an individual use, or from the back, like punching them out, if you need to do more then one badge at a time.The writing surface on these is large enough for more then a name, since the labels themselves are plain white.  So you could embellish them with markers or whatever, if you choose too.You do have the option to label them by hand, or by laser or inkjet printer.These labels are flexible, they feel somewhat like paper, light, but they seem more substantial then that.  They do seem like they would stick well, not fall off, but at the same time they are easily removeable, if say you are using them on clothing, as name badges.These name badges are not suitable for all clothing.  They do take off a little bit of material when you peel them off, but they didn't damage the shirt I put them on, it was more like fuzz on the back of the name badge.  I guess comparable to other name badges.  I haven't worn that many name badges in my lifetime to really compare.I wanted these in part for labeling sheet protectors, where I label the front of the sheet protector, usually by year, but there is room on the label if I want to add more information.There are 160 name badges, so more then enough for more then one use, for many projects.It would have been nice had they had some decorative border, to give them some personality, instead of just plain white, but then the way they are, you are only limited by your own imagination.Another reliable, multi purpose product from Avery.\", \"I've used Scotch packing tape products before, but never a dispenser for this size roll.  Like the smaller dispensers I've used in the past, this dispenser makes using the tape a breeze.  Just pull out the desired amount of tape, rip it across the built in cutter and you're done.  I have no way to test the strength claims of this tape, but it does seem to be a bit heftier than the tape I'm accustomed to using, so it certainly seems likely that it would be stronger.  The roll of tape appears to be a conventional size, so the dispenser can probably be reused.\", 'These are your standard sticky notes in a large assorted colored pad (exactly as shown in picture).  The one thing that distinguishes them from other sticky note pads that I have used is that the pad is held together not only by the glue on each note but also by a glue binding.  I really like that feature because it is harder to accidentally pull the pad apart.  My problem with this pad is that the adhesive is weak and once a sheet is pulled off the note does not stick down well and the corners both start pulling up within a matter of seconds.  I would not purchase these for that reason alone.', \"I can't really complain about this stapler. I love Swingline products and this is no exception.

It was very easy to set up out of the box and didn't come with a bunch of unnecessary packing. It arrives with a total of six rubber feet, three each of two different heights. These attach to the bottom of the platform with a peel off adhesive, so I recommend testing out both heights before deciding which to use. Then it has a long strip of velcro which allows you to attach one side to the platform and the other to the wrist rest and results in them sticking together.  I'm not sure why they chose to use velcro rather than an adhesive, but it seems to work just as well. As for the overall use it has been very nice for me.  My work is a lot of typing, so anything that helps my wrists, hands and/or arms from getting tired is great. The only complaint I would have is the price point on this seems a tad high, but I guess for some the benefit will be worth it.I've added in a few pictures of the set-up at my desk to see how it looks.\", \"It doesn't say it is anything like the Power Ease; I assumed it would be something like it; if it were not a hassle; would send this wimpy stapler back.

I think others here have attested to the functionality of the TI-30, so I just want to emphasize that it's a tough little gadget as well. Yes, the buttons are on the small side and there is a bit of play, but this was never a major problem (although at times it slows down data entry). You can go to [...] for a good overview of TI calculators, and you can scope out one of TI's major competitors at [...]A Little History:This was also one of the first commercially available low-priced calculators that had two-line display and backspace to correct or edit data entry.  The dual-power and scrolling display features were also once unusual.  The top line (for data entry) shows up to 11 characters; you can scroll backwards or forwards up to 88! The bottom line (shows results) displays up to a 10-digit answer along with a 2-digit exponent.Individual Needs Differ:From the reviews here, it appears that high school math is now more difficult than it once was.  If you know that you're going to need graphing capability, then obviously this is not the choice for you.  Similarly, the prevalence of laptop computers and math/stats software may obviate the need for some of the more advanced features.Recommendation:The layout is very good and, for such a low price, it packs a lot of calculating might.  However, high school (or college)students may want to narrow their choices and then ask their teacher which one has the most relevant functions for the next few years of math. Compared to twenty-five or so years ago, one can now get a lot more calculator for the money. Depending on your budget, therefore, you might determine that a calculator like this is sufficient for your short-term needs, but that you'll need a new one if you go on to more advanced stats and math.  In any event, this is a durable calculator that works very well.\", \"After three hours on hold with various levels of Ricoh tech support I was told that there is no Mac driver for this printer.

Nothing on the Amazon description noted that it was Windows only.\", \"Scotch Tear by Hand Packaging Tape is a newer product from Scotch, the best- known name in household tape. I have been using Scotch tape products for as long as I can remember but this, Scotch Tear by Hand Packaging Tape, is the first clear tape I have purchased from Scotch that doesn't include a tear- off bar. With this tape, you simply select a tape size of your own choosing, hold the edge, and tear it manually, without the aid of a serrated cutting bar.I like being able to tear by hand and this feature is a nice change of pace from other packing tapes, which often include a pertruding, metal bar needed to cut the tape. However, one fact about this tape that I noticed immediately is that the tape has to be gripped just right before tearing is possible. The best way to tear off a piece of this tape is to press the edge of the tape with one thumb, then grip the edge between the index finger and thumb of the opposite hand, and tear. The process is similar to the way you grip and tear open, say, a bag of potato chips. It sounds simple enough, but it can get a little frustrating if you do not have fingernails.Another reason it helps to have fingernails when dispensing this product is that it makes it easier to start a piece of tape. With traditional tape dispensers, it is easy to grab and begin a new piece of tape because the tape is ready to go at all times- all you have to do is lift up the tape, from the cutting bar, pull the desired length, and then tear it across the cutting bar. With this product, all you have is an open roll of tape, and that means you must rotate the tape, find the edge, gradually work it loose with a fingernail, and then pull off a piece. Each time you use the tape, the process must be repeated. For this reason, Scotch Tear by Hand Packaging Tape isn't very useful when you need to tape quickly. In these instances, a roll of tape with a cutting bar is a must.Tape is essential and Scotch is certainly the name- brand leader in clear tape, packing tape, and most other types of tape. I like that Scotch has created this new style of tape and I agree that it is a nice change of pace and good for convenience purposes. The price is quite high and it can get frustrating for those without long fingernails, but this is still a handy product that makes a good addition to your office supply cabinet.\", 'only .5\" high not 1\"other than obvious lack of function due to height, the material is good, no leaks, does not stiffen up over time, no bad smellInnovera is a better brand', \"Graph paper is a requirement for some math and science classes, and it can make note taking and organizing easier.

To cut costs, I have stopped using the priority bubble envelopes from the UPS and tried using these envelopes as a substitute.+++ USEAGE AND RELIABILITY +++The envelopes are a little thinner than what you get by purchasing a name brand but, considering how many more you get for the same amount of money, a slightly lesser quality is expected.The bubbles are rather thin inside the envelope and so I purchased a roll of bubble wrap to double insulate items shipped inside the envelope for added protection.The self sealing lip on the envelope is not very strong. To make sure the envelope seals properly I add two stapes through the edge of the envelope on the side with the opening.+++ CONCLUSION +++The expression \"You get what you pay for\" rings very true with these envelopes. These items are worth the purchase if you are willing to put up with average to sub-average quality product in the name of saving money.', 'I wanted to like this stapler. I truly did. But, I\\'m afraid that it\\'s cool future-retro design just doesn\\'t hold up in the functionality department. If anyone has used staplers for several years, they\\'ll know that there are some that tend to jam more than others. Unfortunately, it looks like Swingline\\'s Green Fashion Stapler falls into that category. It worked well enough the first few times it was use, but before it even needed to be refilled, it started to jam. Try to collate more than 10 standard weight pages and you\\'re asking for trouble.I use and have owned a number of quality Swingline staplers. While jamming is always a potential issue, this lightweight model seems to have a predilection for it. Is it the fault of the staples or the stapler? I\\'d have to go with the later because my  old747 Black Classic Desk Staplerhas no problems and keeps on chugging. My\"Office Space\" Rio Red Staplerworks reliably as well -- also based off the 747 design.I suppose the bottom line is to go with proven models when it comes to stapling.

The pockets are very convenient for papers handed out in class that do not have holes already punched in or are partial pieces of paper. I sometimes carry a single hole punch with me, but at home I have a 3-hole puncher, so I prefer to do a stack of papers when I get home (e.g., the first day of class when each teacher/professor/instructor hands out their syllabus). The colors are very vibrant and the tabs stick out farther than other papers in my notebook so it is easy to find the section I need.Unfortunately, after only one semester, I've noticed one of the dividers has a rip along the slant of the pocket. A few of the tabs are also looking extremely beat up. My notebook is in and out of my backpack a few times a day, less this semester than the last one, and I'm sure this is what has caused the slight damage. But that is typical use for many notebooks and so should have been considered when creating the product.

World's tiniest bulletin board?The bad: The dimensions listed include the frame. The frame is slightly larger than 1.5 inches wide (meaning more than 3 inches total space lost, when you include both sides or top and bottom).  The result is a usable cork area of only 7.75 x 13.75 (compared to 11 x 17 product size). Yes, that's right -- less than the width of a standard piece of paper if using in portrait orientation.The silly: the mounting screws that are included are far too large for a board of this diminutive size. Each screw is 1.5 inches long, and comes with a plastic anchor as well. Big holes in the wall, to hang a tiny bulletin board.The good: Cork is good, there's ample cardboard backing so even a longish push-pin (3/8 inch) won't go through to the wall behind, and the sticker with the Quartet logo is easily removed. Too bad they used such a large frame.Bottom line: Perfect if you need to pin up business cards (it will hold 16 cards, if you jam them right against each other), or four 3x5 photos (that's all it will hold).

I use this to store a variety of items such as AA batteries, glue, mini headphones, different wires and cables, etc. This has a small footprint and the different size drawers work well for my needs.2. I have read other reviews complaining that this is made out of plastic, and that it is not as sturdy as something made out of wood or metal. True, but this costs a lot less, and is more than adequate for my needs.3. I have no trouble seeing into the different drawers, nor do I have any trouble opening and closing them. On the other hand I do not plan to make heavy duty use out of this. If I did, then I would probably buy something more durable.4. I keep this in my computer room, and like that it is not the standard white of many plastic storage cabinets.5. This is free standing and does not have to be attached to anything, yet is stable enough to open and close drawers without worrying about knocking it over.Bottom line: This is a relatively inexpensive way to to store lots of different items, particularly smaller items since 30 of the 39 drawers are fairly small.

The pushpins are great, they do the job. 5-stars would be awarded if the box did not pop open so easily. I would purchase item again.', \"I have always used HP printers in the past, in particular the HP Photosmart series but decided to give Canon a try. What drew me in was the duplex printing. Here's how the whole process went.INSTALLATION: Installation was fine on the first computer. It was easy to set it up and easy to set up the WiFi but when I went to set up the other computer with the printer, no matter what I did, it would sync up once via WiFi and then never again. It just did not recognize the second computer no matter what I did whereas there were no problems with the first. I ended up having to use the USB cable to hook the second one up whereas the first computer is still using WiFi.WIFI PRINTING: This is a great feature since it means both my computers can print, except that only one of the printers was really using the WiFi printing. What I've noticed is that there is quite a bit of lag to print when using WiFi and I never really had this problem before. I think it's almost a minute before I hear the printer start to move.DUPLEX PRINTING: This is what initially drew me in. Be sure you actually set the settings to use duplex printing or it won't print on both sides. Most of the applications did not set the duplex setting as a default. What the printer does is it will print the first page out then feed the paper back in and turn it around and do the second side. Make sure the paper you're feeding is not too thick though. I was trying to do this for printing out a card but it jams the printer when it is anything but the standard letter paper.SCANNING: I was a little bit disappointed with the scanning feature of this as when I scanned my pictures in, it just didn't capture all the colors and sharpness that the actual picture had. I have to admit that my HP printer/scanner combo did a better job of scanning the kind of quality pictures that I expected.COPYING: Copying worked fine and I didn't have any problems with copying something. It is just like all the rest printer/scanner/copier combinations in this aspect.INK: I will say that the ink does seem to last a little bit longer than HP printers but the ink itself are also a bit more expensive. I think I've seen it for about $45 for both color and black.Now for the kicker, I have been using the printer fine until just a few days ago when I tried to print something and it suddenly jammed. I didn't do anything different. The paper was still the same kind that I've been using and nothing has changed. The feed just suddenly crinkled the paper together so it jammed. I removed the paper jam but now, the printer doesn't work anymore. I've submitted a support ticket with Canon as I've already cleared the paper jam, powered it off and back on and still getting an error message. The error message even tells you that you have to contact support if it is still not fixed. This is pretty aggravating as it was the only functional printer at the moment in my house and now I cannot print until I get in touch with support and try to figure out what happened. But to have this kind of issue from a simple paper jam? I would've given this one more star if it wasn't for that issue. A paper jam should be something where once it is removed, then the issue is no more.UPDATE: I got in touch with Canon's customer service and I will give them props for a prompt response and getting me a replacement in the mail very quickly. I didn't have to pay for shipping or return shipping and the item worked right out of the box. Now I just hope I don't run into this issue again.\", 'At first unboxing, I like the fact that it has a clear plastic case holding all 8 highlighters, so you can pack them in a bag or briefcase and keep them organized.  The retraction of the tip is nice, so you don\\'t need to worry about caps.COLORI\\'m not very excited about the color selection.  With highlighters, I would think that you choose a variety of light shades, so as to not put a dark color over a black font to make it more difficult to read.  I found the green, red and light blue to be a little darker than my preference, although they are not too bad.  The dark blue and purple are just too dark.  The orange and pink are fine.  I like the yellow\\'s fluorescence and brightness.WIDTHThese are a little narrow on the tip for my taste.  The broadest stroke I could get was about 3mm, which is the size of a capital letter in Times New Roman size 12.  My current highlighters are about 4.2mm, which I like better.SMEARINGThe marketing of these highlighters seems to be focused on the fact that these have \"SMEAR GUARD Technology.\"  If you read the fine print, it says to make sure to let the ink dry before highlighting -- that\\'s fair.  It also says that it resists smearing of many pen and marker inks based on consumer surveys.  I\\'d like to know how that all was tested.In my own testing, I found minimal difference between these and my Hi-Liter brand.  With a few rollerball pens, I could see a tiny bit less smearing with these highlighters.  With a printout from my HP OfficeJet Pro K5400, the smearing was a mess.  Even the next day, both brands of highlighters couldn\\'t resist smearing badly.However, on my HP DeskJet 5650, both highlighters performed perfectly by not smearing.There may be some inks that resist smearing by these highlighters, but I didn\\'t find them.Overall, this is a decent set of highlighters, but I don\\'t find them to be standing out from the competition.', 'My late husband ordered this and could not get it to work after set up--even after calling the HP tech line.  He returned it and ordered the Cannon, which I did not like, so I gave it away after he died.', \"The Post-it Laptop Note Dispenser is a great idea, and it could have been a slam dunk.  However it comes up short of its potential.  The first issue I noticed is a minor one, but I still found it annoying.  While it is not the most complicated product, you have to remove the adhesive strip on the back in order to get to the instructions.  They probably could have done with one fewer pictures on the back of the outer packaging and placed the instructions there too.  The other issue is much more of a deal breaker.  The dispenser is designed to work with the accordion style Post-it Notes so the opening has to be in the middle to accommodate this.  As a result, almost half of the note is inaccessible for writing without dispensing.  Even if you don't write on the note before dispensing, the notes come out bent, wrinkled, or torn if not all three.  The one design aspect that 3M succeeded on was the adhesive.  It does come off without leaving residue, and it re-affixes securely afterward.  I just wish they had pulled off the overall design with the same degree of success.

You know, the ones with little to no text, cryptic graphics that only a child could love, no photos and the infamous parts list of A to Z. That's exactly what you get with Safco's Scoot Desk-Side Printer Stand.Well, almost. There is one significant difference with this product--and it's a big deal. Other to-be-assembled furniture (including some of Safco's own products) have lettered stickers on the various parts so that you can match them up with the part letters on the drawings. You get no such help from Safco on their Scoot Desk-Side Printer Stand. You are left to figure out what each item is by studying the less than clear instruction sheet drawings.Okay, some things are obvious. There is only one Leg Frame (part B) and it looks different from anything else. However, try to tell the Adjustable Shelf (part G) from the Bottom Panel (part F) and you have your work cut out for you. (Here's a hint. There is a subtle difference and the instructions do attempt to illustrate this. G has a double flange on the front, F does not. So look carefully.)This furniture is black on black on black. (The panels are black, the shelves are black and--wait for it--the screws are black.) If you haven't yet had the fun of looking inside a totally black stand to try and determine if the black screws are tight or not, you are in for a frustrating adventure. You may need to borrow a 5,000 watt movie flood lamp to have enough light to see if you tightened everything down.Speaking of the screws, they are all the same. It doesn't matter if you are screwing into the pressboard top or the aluminum legs, you use exactly the same type screw. And those screws don't seem to want to penetrate the press board. They bind long before they are fully meshed. Now, this is a total mystery. There is nothing as easy to punch a hole through then pressboard, yet these screws don't seem up to the task. They do better into the aluminum legs, although on my stand one of the legs had a screw hole that wasn't tapped properly and the screw resisted being tightened down into that hole.While we are speaking of the screws, they come in a plastic bag inside of the parts box. My unit had a punctured plastic bag, so instead of being nicely contained they were scattered all about inside of the parts box. That should not have been the case.The last surprise was the casters. Keep in mind that you are assembling the unit upside down at first and then on its side when installing the casters. The casters do not lock into the caster sockets. They just slide into the hole. In fact, the so-called caster socket is nothing more than a hole drilled into a piece of plastic that is shoved into the legs. Once you install the casters and begin to tilt the unit right side up, the casters fall out. There is nothing to hold them in place other than good old gravity. That made for several frustrating moments at the end of the installation. If Safeco had thought to have the casters lock into the caster sockets (like it does on other manufacturer's furniture,) tilting the unit up would have been a non-issue. Instead I wound up installing the casters by laying on the floor with the unit right side up and lifting one leg at a time.I really debated whether to give the Scoot Desk-Side Printer Stand two stars or three stars. In terms of usability as a printer or scanner stand once it's completed, it's probably a three star rating. However, the poor instructions and the thoughtless way that some of the parts go together (especially those caster wheels) really deserves a one star rating. So, in the end, I decided that two stars is probably the fairest rating I can offer Safeco on this Scoot Desk-Side Printer Stand.\", 'Women of the World unite!

The AMPAD envelope has a wide strip of adhesive that is covered up by a paper strip and therefore, you have nothing sticky to deal with--you put your item in the envelope, pull the paper strip off, fold down the envelope flap and you're done.  This product has a very narrow strip of adhesive (about a third the size of the AMPAD's adhesive strip) that is covered by part of the envelope itself.  You put your item in the envelope, pull UP the lower flap of the envelope covering the adhesive and then fold DOWN the top envelope flap to meet the adhesive strip you just unfolded.The worst part of using this envelope was that with all the hot, humid weather we are having right now, the lower flap gave me some resistance in coming away from the adhesive.  Then I had to make sure the lower flap was laying flat before I closed the upper flap over it (while avoiding getting my fingers in the adhesive).  I actually ripped the envelope flap the first time I used one.Security-wise, the imprint inside the envelope seemed fine to me.  I put in a piece of paper with heavy ink writing on it and could not see it up against a light.  Then again, that piece of paper was probably a little heavier stock than a check would be.  The imprint of the AMPAD envelope was much darker and more dense, so I'd say that it has superior security as well.  Even once this product was closed and sealed, it was ridiculously easy to open!!  Some security.For me, the bottom line is whether I'd buy the product again, and I would not buy this product again.  I will probably keep these as an emergency supply of envelopes for when I run out of the AMPADs, but don't plan to use these on a regular basis.\", \"I have routinely spent a lot of money on nice, colorful gift wrap and then, when I get the gift wrapped all that seems to stand out is the tape that is used to seal the package.

I used this tape on both a solid blue colored wrap and a mulit-colored paper and it worked great on both.

The scans are beautiful, and I expected the same quality workmanship that kept the 1640SU working for many years.However, as soon as I placed a larger book in the scanner and closed the lid, two plastic tabs broke inside.  The scanner made a noisy ratcheting sound and the red light started flashing.How can the plastic break so easily?  When I took the scanner apart with the screwdriver I was amazed at how cheap and thin the plastic is in this model!  Epson must be really cost-cutting in their manufacturing process these days.I searched the web to find out how to fix the scanner.  I came across a post by another customer who had the exact same problem.  He also broke the plastic tabs, and replaced them with a custom piece of metal.When I removed the plastic fragments from inside the scanner, it started working again.  However I am not sure how long it will last.  The glass is held on to the inside with self-adhesive tape, and the glass already started to separate when I placed a heavier object on top.This is a great scanner for high-quality photos.  But it's constructed like a disposable camera.  It will do fine if your scan jobs consist of single photos or single sheets of paper.  But if you scan a document/book with multiple sheets consider getting a different scanner made with sturdy materials.I hope Epson will learn that they went a bit too far with the cost-cutting on materials.  I am surprised because my experience has always been that Epson creates some of the best printers/scanners.\", 'This review is for the SECOND version of this calculator, the slightly-larger, grey, BLACK and white model, with a rounded \"mound\" housing the keypad.  I had actually ordered the older model -- the light-grey model, with the blue and white keys, slightly smaller, which I had had previously, but sadly lost.  I had considered returning this newer model, but finally decided against it, as it is now listed as being discontinued by the manufacturer, so -- if I returned the newer one I did get, I very well might have gotten the same model back..........I was, at first, extremely disappointed in the newer model.  (Why both the newer model and the older model -- which look COMPLETELY DIFFERENT -- have the VERY SAME MODEL NUMBER is completely beyond me.

With a neat little separate oompartment for the battery changing, the rest of the back of the machine need not be disturbed at all!This is all the more important, as more and more calculators, sadly, are made with \"no user-replaceable batteries\" enclosed, (no -- one is instructed, in these other, still newer calculators, to take them to the nearest authorized repair shop, of the designated manufacturer -- and have them replaced there, like wrist-watch batteries!

It also has the nice, l a r g e numberic display, which is not only on this newer model 1795SV, but also on the older model 1795SV.....and also on the belated, dearly loved, and sadly lost original Texas Instrument \"1795\" model, (no \"sv\"), which I once had, and enjoyed more than both of the \"1795sv\" models put together!  (It was small, handy, and a beautiful medium-bone-yellow in colour.  It also seemed to stay on FOREVER -- pr at least an hour or so, if I remember correctly.  Oh, that Texas Instruments would bring THAT model back, sigh!)Well, this NEW m0del 1795SV -- though NOT the older, handier model 1795SV, nor the original model 1795 -- still has many good points, most of which are delineated above.  It is also a desk-top model which can be carried in a pocket-book, if necessary -- and also in a briefcase, but not in a wallet.  It is bigger than the two previous models in the Texas Instrument 1795 line...but does have that priceless customer-replacable battery chamber.  Although I do prefer the previous two models, this newer one, now available, is not a bad little calculator, all things considered.But I would still welcome, (greatly!), the return of the original 1795 model, and/or the original 1795sv.', \"Ok, so I admit it. I often use postal service shipping labels that are 'technically' used for priority mailing, cut them down (to take off the reference to 'priority') and use them for standard mailing of items. So, I guess feeling guilty that I was 'stealing', when I saw these shipping labels on Amazon, I scapped them up in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, I find these labels too small for my taste. In order for me to handwrite my return address and shipping address (and with a son in the military overseas there are 5 lines of address I need to enter), I found the labels inadequate. Perhaps if I had a really tiny handwriting, or if I was able to some how type labels (where are the oldfashioned typewriters when you really need them?), they would work fine. But for my use, I don't like them and would not purchase them in the future.Glue seems adequate, so I am sure they hold fine, it's the size that is no good for my shipping.\", 'I work online and a good portion of my day is spent on the keyboard. I love it! But after constant stress on the hands and the back, I was starting to feel some discomfort in those areas. When I saw this offered on the Amazon Vine program, I decided to give it a try. I was really surprised after trying it out to find what a nice difference it makes. My wrists rest comfortably on the wrist platform instead of rubbing against the edge of my desk as they did before. After working with my keyboard and using the 3M Tilt Gel Rest Platform, I realized that this was something I needed but didn\\'t know I needed it. I also find it helps me to sit up straighter as I use it.The product comes with instructions, the platform, adjustable \"feet\", velcro adhesive and the gel wrist rest. I opted not to use the feet to adjust it as my keyboard has a build in tilt to it. In addition, I did not feel it was necessary to adhere the gel wrist rest to the platform as it is heavy enough to stay in place and will be easier to clean.The product is also sleek and attractive in a dark neutral color. It blends well with my desk and gives a finished look to it. My keyboard fits on it nicely.Overall, this is a nice product. I deducted one star because as other reviewers mentioned, the adjustability of it is comprimised by the fact that once you stick the feet on, you are stuck with that angle - so really it is not so adjustable. I do like it enough that I will be looking into purchasing the mouse rest to go with it.It is always a good idea to give the body as little stress as possible from repititive movements and this really helps. If you suffer from severe wrist pain, I would suggest you also look into Dragon Naturally Speaking.~ Lee Mellott', \"I have very limited space in my home and that certainly holds true for my pantry. It's not that I collect a lot of junk but everyday items just seem to be overflowing. I bought this cart to put outside my pantry door to hold all those items which the pantry can't hold. When I need to get into the pantry, I just roll the cart a foot out of the way and roll it back when I'm done digging around in there. This cart truly makes my life so much easier.This cart is very sturdy and well built, I just LOVE it ! It rolls around easily on my tile floors and it holds lots and lots. I really didn't understand the directions on how to put it together but by just looking at the parts and the photo on the box you can easily figure it out for yourself. I'm already thinking about buying another cart for a back closet where it will help create an organized place as well. Don't hesitate to buy this if you need more space,it really does the trick !\", 'Life is too short to wrap gifts with \"bargain\" tape...Ok, perhaps that is going a bit far, but when I think about all the times I have struggled with tough, bargain brand tape when I am trying to wrap a gift, it makes me wonder what I was thinking.  Sure, if it is what you have at the time, then cheap tape can get the job done.But if you are anything like me, wrapping a gift nicely is enough of a struggle.  Dealing with tape that doesn\\'t want to break when you cut it, tape that won\\'t cut straight, tape that is slightly yellow, well, for me anyhow that is a frustration I am glad to do without during the holidays.  By the time I am done struggling with some off brand roll of tape, it certainly doesn\\'t seem like a \"bargain\".I would not go so far as to say this tape is invisible, but the satiny finish somehow blends in just perfectly on the wrapping paper to where you almost can\\'t see it.And with 3 rolls, it means no arguing for the tape roll when I am wrapping gifts with the kids.I would say that I was somewhat surprised at how little tape was on each roll. I am not sure if that was because I got it as promotional item,  but as I said having the 3 separate rolls comes in handy, especially if you have kids.Sure, kids will find something else to argue about, and you will find other problems to concern yourself with, but tape doesn\\'t have to be one of them if you use Scotch brand gift tape. As I like to say - quality doesn\\'t really cost, it pays.', 'The Quartet Prestige Colored Cork Board is a great, standard bulletin board.The board itself is 3 x 2 feet in size and comes with all the hardware needed to install it.  The board was packed well and there were no defects on inspection.  The cork board is a neutral, mid-range black/brown variety.  As such, it would fit in nicely with either dark or light wood furniture.  The frame is what they call a &#8216;graphite finish,&#8217; but the sides look more dark brown to me and the top and bottom are somewhat more grey.  On the whole, the board has a very professional appearance.This is a pretty standard installation--nothing terribly difficult, but it does take some careful measuring to make sure that the board is level.  To install this you will need a light duty drill and a screwdriver.  Basically, four identical anchors are placed in the wall.  These are flat pieces with an edge curl to fit into grooves at the top and bottom of the board.  You line them up to fit in a groove at the bottom an the top of the board.  I anchored the bottom two firmly.  The top two were reasonably tight, but loose enough to move the anchor up and down (there is a slot on each anchor for the screw, not just a hole).  You place the bottom of the board onto the anchors then fit the top ones in place.  My first impression was that this would not be a strong enough way to anchor the board to the wall, but the board seems rock solid and stays in place.The cork board works well with the usual pins and is considered self-healing.  On the whole, the self-healing, which seems to be true, as the holes form an average size pin seem to disappear when you remove the pin.  The board works well, although as you push pins into the center of the board, you can feel a little bit of give as you push.  So far, this has not posed any problems.Generally, this is a handsome, serviceable cork board that would work well in either the home or office.  Recommended.', 'It\\'s a label. I\\'m not going to try to wax poetic about it. But it\\'s a very good label. The basics:*The labels feed smoothly into my laser printer and emerge the same way. No jamming, no smearing.*The TrueBlock (TM) Technology works well. This allows you to reuse manila envelopes and boxes without looking so much like you\\'re recycling them...as long as the original label isn\\'t larger than 2 inches by four inches. (A fairly generous size for a single address; small to include address of origin alongside the address of destination.)  They retain a professional, clean appearance.*The bright white of the templates contrasts beautifully with dark print, keeping visibility clear. Again, professional and clean.*In addition, Avery will give you support as you use them. On the back of each sheet they\\'ve printed (in two languages) tips for use and directions for where to go on the web to get templates for Microsoft Word on the web or through e-mail. (Not sure why they need my name and e-mail address for me to download these templates, but they promise not to Spam me. I\\'m trusting that it\\'s because it gives them the opportunity to ask me to opt-in to e-mails...the default. I opted out.) In addition to the blank template for mailing labels (be sure you enter the product number, 5263, to easily access the right ones!), there are \"specialized\" templates for use particularly with color printers. Current themes include holidays, seasons, special events (birth, wedding, graduation), patriotic and a host of various business ideas (dental, salon, etc.) They currently have 57 downloads available in support of this one product.All in all, a good solid product with really exceptional support from an industry leader. I\\'ll feel confident in ordering this product again.', 'Great for my home business to record business mileage. It holds plenty of pages to last throughout the year, instructions on how to keep records (and information about the relevant tax laws), and a place to keep maintenance and repair records.', 'The instructions for these business cards sends you to the Avery site online, where you create your cards.  There are both blank cards and ones with designs available, for all types of businesses.  I chose a blank one, so I could add my own picture, instead of using a design.  I did not find the software easy to use.  And I could not for the life of me figure out how to do the back side...unless, you do the front first, print, go back to the software and choose \"back side\", and then stick the paper back in the printer again.  Finally, I just gave up, and decided to use the Microsoft Digital Image 2006 I have on my desktop, which I\\'ve used for previous business cards.Before turning on the desktop, though, I decided to try to install Digital Image 2006 on my laptop.  I never thought about doing that before, since the laptop has Vista.  Well, it installed with no problems, and no configurations needed, very quickly.  And it\\'s working beautifully.  With Digital Image, you can also choose cards that have designs, or are blank so you can add a picture.  I find Digital Image far easier to use than Avery\\'s software.  And when you print, it gives you 20 choices of business card types with numbers.  It has the number for these Avery cards, so printing was also a breeze on my Canon i960. The cards are beautiful, though not glossy, and easily separate by folding.  I decided not to do a back side, since most people don\\'t look at the back of business cards anyway.', \"This product arrived early and in excellent condition.  However, I'm a moron and didn't read the size of 5x7.

He is careful with mechanisms and appreciates the lighter weight of this stapler. It came with a box of 5,000 staples and a great staple remover.  He will be careful not to drop it and it fastens the paper tightly.I highly recommend this stapler if you just do occasional stapling but Bostich if you do quite a bit of stapling.', 'Like all Avery labels I have tried, these work great.

It disappears on gift wrap paper that doesn't have a super glossy finish.  Almost every gift wrap that you'll find in stores will have a finish that works well with Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.The convenient three pack has plenty of tape for a pampered child's birthday or for three of Santa's elves to wrap a reindeer load of gifts. (Seriously, 25 yds. of tape is a whole lot of tape)For those of you traveling this holiday season with a small child who must be quiet, I offer one other use for this tape.  Give your little kid a roll of tape and let him/her play with it.  They'll have strips of tape going all over the airplane seat and the tiny amount of space alotted to a passenger.  When the plane lands, and Junior has finished with his tape, just roll it up into a ball and toss it into the closest trash container.  I can't guarantee that this will work for everyone, but it kept my 2 year old quiet in her car seat during a 9 hour flight to Europe.  She played with the tape until she tired of it, then fell asleep as I removed the played-with tape.\", 'simply very similar to the one that cost 5 times more! does what it suppose to do for much much less.', \"I hung this set of markers on my family's dry erase calendar.  The colors are vibrant and the writing is smooth and sharp with all the markers except the orange one which has never worked well.  Unfortunately, the magnet on one of the markers fell off by the second day, and the felt erasers pop in and out of the lids too easily.  They serve their purpose, but the quality leaves a lot to be desired.\", \"The Avery Clean Edge Business Cards came out of my printer looking very nice. I have an older printer which is an Epson Stylus CX4200. The cards came out nicely centered on the card stock and the printing and picture is crisp and clean. I was sure to change the settings of my printer to let it know that it was thicker card stock and told it to use the best print setting. The ink dried very quickly so there was no worry about smearing the cards. The top and bottom of the card edges seem to come out cleaner than the side edges of the cards. The side edges still feel a little rough. While these are not as thick as a professional business card, they are decent and good to use for somebody that may just be starting up or need cards in a hurry. The price is good for what you get so that is also a plus for someone who may have a small budget to start out with. The web site was super easy to use to design the business cards. There were a lot of premade cards to choose from and all you have to do is put your personal information on the cards. There is also templates so you can design your own cards from scratch. I used a premade template to do my cards and I had them all done with in 5 minutes. Overall, a good product for the price that you pay. If your looking for professional business cards though, these probably aren't for you as the card stock is thinner than professional cards.\", 'I wanted to like this Westcott iPoint Evolution electric pencil sharpener because it does have a solid design and looks like it should function better than most other sharpeners. The problem is, it doesn\\'t. I tried two different types of pencils, both number 2, and in both cases the point was not as sharp as I\\'m used to getting with my other electric sharpener or my manual sharpener. I also have to agree with the excess wood by the tip being a problem that I\\'ve found unique to this sharpener. I tried several brand new pencils, and tried them several times to see if I could perfect a solution to get a quality sharpening, but I failed miserably. Maybe it\\'s user error, but this isn\\'t my first rodeo working with pencil sharpeners so I highly doubt it.In the end, this will probably sit unused for a while because I have two other sharpeners that I know do a quality job each time I use them.

In practice, it has some problems:- Because there is no end flipping around, it is actually a bit harder to extract that single sticky sheet. One has to pry up a corner.- Once I had the note out and ready to post, the extra sticky made it difficult to figure out which end of the sheet had the \"real\" sticky. Most of the entire note felt sticky on the back.- It really didn\\'t make any difference, because the sticky notes do not stick; they begin to come off almost immediately. The company needs to put more or different glue on there.I appreciate the design intent, and I like that the packages support schools via the \"Box Tops for Education\".

Unfortunately, I must not have received the same product as many of the other reviewers on this page, since I sharpened three pencils before I heard a rather devastating &#34;click&#34;&#8230;and now it won't sharpen a thing. I cleaned out the blade because while the unit still turns, it's obvious something is keeping it from accomplishing the job, and while I cannot visibly see anything, it still will not sharpen a pencil. The pencil's end remains dull and rounded as the unit spins, even with slight pressure. I admit that I could not remove the blade from the unit because the plastic cup which it resides in makes it almost impossible to do so without unscrewing the whole unit (if it's even possible). So while it looks nice, it certainly does not do the job, and I am highly disappointed with this product.\", 'I was used to the regular sharpie that kind of spreads out after it is used a couple of times.

Second, I bought it brand new, have been using it less than a month, have not printed a significant amount and my ink levels are much lower than I expected for the use! I bought this printer because it claimed to be an excellent printer with low ink cost.

I have to have it on \"quality\" setting. This seems to be eating up ink like crazy. I didn\\'t even get to use the printer for three weeks before I had to change the ink cartridges. And as someone said in a review - it wont print unless all the cartridges are at a certain level.

Well once I replaced it then the magenta one died. I was using Canon ink and not cheap replacement ones. I used very good quality paper and photo paper.

When it was working right it spent an inordinate amount of time in the purge cycle, basically dumping ink into the pad next to the heads. Frustrated me to no end, mainly because when the nozzle issue happened the first time I burned through 2 other cartridges trying to figure out what happened.Overall the quality was ok, I liked the pictures I made with it until it died. I would buy another Canon product again. I just think I got a lemon with this one. When I bought it it was nearly hundred more dollars. At this price it is now its not a bad deal.

I do make a point of giving my thumbs up and down on the various packages that I receive from Amazon.Anyway, about this binder.  It is a good, one-hand closing binder.  It is also quite expensive, $11+ for a binder with a 2\" spine depth. I think the most unique quality about this binder is that it is PVC free, which means that your photocopies and such aren\\'t going to stick to the cover and peel off onto the binder like all of the other ones you have.Not included in this binder are the plastic \"sheet lifters\", which are the boomerang-type pieces of plastic that you use to push back all of the pages in the binder without ripping them out of their holes.

The simple lack of paper in between the columns of labels does wonders for the ease of peeling off a label.  Why this isn't a common practice for all printable stickers is the real question.  No more bending the paper to peel one off.  On my inkjet printer the printed labels look wonderful as far as colors and clarity.  With the template I was able to customize several mailing labels for different seasons and different addresses.  The labels affix to envelopes easily and I haven't noticed any peeling.  I have only used the labels on regular envelopes, so I don't know how they would hold up on any other type of packaging (such as padded envelopes), but will update if I ever find out.  The labels could have been a little longer to allow for a longer address in larger fonts or a small picture/clip art, but I still was able to put a small jack-o-lantern in front of my friend's address when sending her a Halloween card (only really sent her one so I could use more labels just for fun).  I just had to use a smaller font next to the clip art, but it still is a good size.Word of caution:  Depending on your printer, the printing may be off center or higher on the label than expected.  I'm almost positive this is my printer because I have had this issue with mailing seals as well, but just wanted to advise others to check this before printing many labels.\", \"I am married to a woman who sells lots of things on Ebay.

They were a 'special treat' and great quality. Since this was a good price on Amazon I decided to give it a try. I was very disappointed as an overall writing instrument. It is a very lightweight, thin, not that comfortable to write with pen. Basically you are paying for the Parker ink cartridge. It ends up, frankly, being a cheap, light, basic case no better than your 10 for $5 pens with a good ink cartridge. So you get what you pay for here: an ink cartridge and a bad, small (men with big hands stay away) very disappointing case that adds nothing to the cartridge at all.\", \"While working at the Fabio fan club, I operated 20 of these for all the hate mail the office received. The Shredder is not that good if you are dealing in high volume, thick paper. Most of the time it was jammed up. The parts are not durable. Another problem I have is that it doesn't Shred bread or old food very well. Pizza crust gets caught in the metal teeth very easily.\", 'This foot rest is easy to set up and is very sturdy. The top has a nice grippy surface that really holds my feet.The only gripe is that it is a bit easy to tip if you put one foot on it close to either edge.', 'I ordered this stand thinking it would be a useful Christmas present for my daughter and son-in-law who will be spending the next year or two writing their doctoral dissertations. Unfortunately, it came in today when I needed to type a bunch from some papers so I set it up in front of my iMac. It fits between the screen and the keyboard perfectly and the tilt is adjustable so I can place it just under the screen view. I also like the elastic line guide, which I found useful in keeping my place on the pages.First, it\\'s great and I again I find myself asking why I don\\'t own more 3M stock. I will get the kids another one because I\\'m keeping this longer format one for me. It allows me to place a book or 2 sheets of paper (I can just about squeeze in a 3rd) across the clear, flat plastic surface and easily see what I am looking at, which is a way more comfortable feat for these 50 year old eyes. Surprisingly, the clear surface appears to be high grade optical plastic and does not distort images underneath. It\\'s a marked improvement over those flimsy aluminum or plastic typewriter paper trays from earlier years.Second, it rates only a \"pretty good\" and not an \"Ah, ha\" from those 3M engineers. I guess it cannot be helped that the stand eats up a foot of prime desk space. This is unhelpful when its use is not necessary. The design suggests it is kind of meant to be semi-permanently fixed: The feet are study with substantial weight to hold heavier papers and such which is good. BUT, I\\'m going to have to be very careful--where the feet attach to the plastic surface is flimsy, not reinforced and bond to break if occasionally moved. I guess that is why the assembly instructions tell you it takes only 30 seconds to attach the base to the feet rather than provide better detail on how to attach. So be warned, this is a handy, very useful product; but, unless you use it continually, you will need to assemble and disassemble the parts to move it to and from your desk. I\\'m keeping the packaging box for storage. At least it has a 5 year warrantee which I bet will be much used, 3M.And I\\'m still buying another one for the kids; I\\'ll probably break down again and get the wider format.

Once in a while, there may a little bubble, but nothing like the swingline sheets.Bottom line.  There are so many positive reviews.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.  A really bad batch.  In any case, I think I'm going to stick with the Amazon Basics Pouches.  They work better and are cheaper.\", \"I used this tape a lot for packing boxes, and for that purpose it worked really well, but with non cardboard items (or where the tape might have to stick to itself) it didn't do as well.PROS:EASE OF USE. when the end of the tape roll gets loose and sticks back to itself it is much easier to peel it back again for usage than other tapes.  (It can do this because the adhesive is not as strong, and the tape doesn't stick to itself as much as other tapes do.)DISPENSER.  It does come with a simple, but easy to use dispenser.  I have no complaints regarding its usage.NOISE.  Because the tape is less sticky, it is less noisy than other tapes.CONS:STICKINESS TO ITSELF.  Because it is not as sticky as other tapes you have to be careful when using that you don't touch the tape to itself, because the tape might eventually come off if someone starts pulling on the parts where the tape is touching the tape...  This means that you have to be careful when wrapping, because if you don't do it with this in mind you are wrapping less securely than you think.* Overall, I like this tape, and the benefit of the end of the tape NOT shredding when I attempt to peel it really makes it worthwhile.  Just be careful how you use it, and what you stick it on, and you should be fine.\", \"I am now hooked on the Avery line of labels.

The surface with the design seems to be a sheet of shiny stock because the ink scratched off exposing the white surface when I was unwrapping it using a pair of scissors and then again when trying to fit it in a file cabinet.  (I thought it might be plastic but it burns rather than melts when a flame is held to it.)It has two cut-out handholds but they are at different heights, only the front flap folds inwards, and they are blocked by papers or file folders so they are only good for a two-handed lift and for that they're not needed, anyway.There is a matching accessory slipcover sold separately that should be included instead--or better yet, a lid that fastens with Velcro instead of the useless handholds, which should be on the ends, not the sides. It should also come with a piece of cardboard to cover the inside of the bottom which has flaps that self-assemble when the box is unfolded but which then won't lay flat and don't seem very secure.  The box is also more of a parallelogram than a rectangle because it won't quite stay unfolded.The description on Amazon is wrong at this time: it doesn't expand except from flat to unfolded.  It is 3 in. deep and holds roughly 1 1/2 reams of standard copy paper.Overall, this file case is rather flimsy, doesn't carry very easily or even function well as a simple box, isn't durable, and looks like something from the $0.99 store once it's scratched up.  I got this as a review sample and am still very disappointed because I was going to use it for tax papers but didn't want to leave it out on my desk.  I ended up cutting off the useless front flap and using part of it to line the bottom.  Since the box is all scratched up (and singed), I'm just going to use it in the front of the file cabinet drawer to hold supplies.\", \"At first glance, this product seems like a quality item ... until you open the package. Overall, I found the folder to be of poor quality, maybe a notch above what you would get at the dollar store. The envelop was composed of thin, cheap paper.

Things that are probably not as good as comparable items that already exist, yet cost much more. How do the developers stay employed?This file box is similar in function to redwelds by the same maker, yet costs 10 times more ($10 each versus $1 each). I checked the descriptions carefully to be sure; $10 is rather steep for a piece of cardboard. Redwelds seem sturdier too.I guess the file box here does perform its stated function, but the cardboard does easily bend and give, so not sure how long it would stand up to normal use. The pattern printed on it is nice, but that wouldn't be much of a selling point if the box stayed in a filing cabinet most of the time. It is supposed to replace paper piles, hanging folders and 3-ring binders; I'm a little doubtful about the last two of these.It is supposed to be expandable, but I don't see how.I don't recommend this product.\", \"SKU codes and product pages change all the time, so I'll avoid linking to what might soon be a dead product here...but buyers should be aware that Scotch is constantly bundling a free dispenser with six or twelve tape refills, often 1000 feet per roll, for a price that is pretty much the same as what you would pay for just the tape.Don't inadvertently leave this dispenser a box in the garage for 5 years.  The glue on the bottom will dry up, releasing the cover and spilling the sand that gives it the ergonomically correct weight for yanking and cutting off tape.Other than that, for me it's the same great, completely uninspiring product that it was in the '80s, the '90s and the Aughts.It amazes me that people buy tape by the single, disposable-dispenser included roll.  You'll get maybe 300 feet and pay as much as you would for the larger refill that fits onto a unit such as this one.  Bought separately, this unit pays for itself after the first one or two refills used.\", \"I've been using their labels for more than 20 years -- they are SO easy to use on the computer, and these 08167 labels print equally well on my Ink Jet AND laser printer.Feeding them through a copier is a cinch too.These 08167 labels peel easily, the ink impressions are sharp and crisp, in color OR black and white.I have had no problem with the Avery labels' adhesive longevity in the past -- let's see how well these 08167's do -- I would think that they will be just as good as their predecessors.\", 'These are great labels to have around.

It does not have the feel of junky thin garbage tape.What I did notice is it feels a lot tackier than other tape. I don't know if this will make it hold better in the long run, but it is definitely sticky.The other pleasant surprise was how quiet the dispenser is.

I could keep the cable in place and mark a letter or two to make sure I remembered what I meant it to be for, and then pull it all back up afterward and everything was kept simple and clean.I'd probably think it's worth investing in something like this when you know you have a big job ahead of you. If I were going to put in all the time it takes to paint a room very  nicely, it's worth spending a few more dollars to try to get tape that's going to do a very good job of helping you get nice results.

However, the execution is sub-par for the following reasons:- Paper - The lines are printed only on 1 side so you cannot really write on the back of each page.  The paper is quite thin so those who enjoy using fountain pens or even some wet gel pens will see bleedthrough on the back of the page.  I used relatively dry-writing extra fine Lamy Safari (with Waterman Havana Brown ink) and extra fine Hero (with Noodler\\'s Black ink) fountain pens and they both showed bleedthroughs.- App - the free app that you can download from the iTunes store is mediocre at best.  When I turned on the camera, there is no indication of whether I had the right angle/zoom.  Additionally, the app is supposed to export the image to my Evernote account.  Even after asking me for authentication, it was unsuccessful in exporting the scanned image to Evernote.  I do not see the advantage of the special symbols as the scanned picture still showed them and the ugly lines.  Why bother with these expensive pads when you can just get a regular pad without the special symbols and use the Evernote app to scan take a picture????  Same results but far cheaper.For those who likes digitizing their notes, there is a better option.  There is a Swedish notebook maker called Whitelines (products available on Amazon) that takes the same concept but executes it far better.  Their Whitelines LINK notebooks have a very light gray background and white lines with the special scan symbols on the 4 corners.  They have an app in the iTunes store that automatically scans the page when it \"sees the special symbols\" and automatically uploads it to Evernote, Dropbox or your email (you check off your choice at the bottom of each page).  Unlike the Ampad app, you don\\'t waste time and effort wondering whether you have found the perfect distance/angle to take a scan.  Then, depending on which box you select at the bottom of the page, the app will automatically deliver your scanned image to Evernote, Dropbox or email.  For those who want a free trial before buying these notebooks, you can get FREE paper templates on the Whitelines website to try it out before committing to the notebook!  Lastly, the paper for the Whitelines Link notebook is fountain pen friendly so you do not have to worry about bleedthrough and you can write on the back of each page.  One last thing, the gray background/white lines combo will \"disappear\" with the scan so you get a nice white background and just your handwriting without distracting lines!  How cool is that!*Note, the regular Whitelines notebooks do not have special symbols for scanning so buy the Whitelines LINK notebook to digitize your notes.', 'They seem to work fine so far.

Anything above 2 pages together, or a folded page, and it jams up. Also, make sure you take any mail out of the envelopes with the clear plastic window because that shouldn't go in a shredder. What caused it to jam beyond repair the very first time I used it: Two pieces of paper that had been folded in half, so the thickness of 4 pages essentially. The description clearly indicates it can handle up to 8 sheets at a time, good luck with that. I have removed the lid and hand picked out every visible piece of paper, I have tried multiple times to utilize the reverse option, and nothing works.

When I first opened the box I \"thought\" I was impressed with the quality feel of it\\'s build...but soon learned it is just a thicker plastic crappy body versus thinner plastic.  Most would think, \"Hey, thicker plastic...sounds stronger\"....uh no, just more cumbersome and heavy for no reason because the doors and hinges are still fragile.  The tray you see sticking out of the back is removable to make storing it a bit easier because you will want to store it.  There are no doors or covers to close off the back of the unit, which is where you feed the paper object in you want to laminate....this is a stupid design because it leaves the laminating roll open to dust and whatever things are floating around in the air settling on your desk or wherever you store this (think animal fur and dust balls....LOTS of them because this sucker is LOADED with static and will attract EVERYTHING that comes near it).  The rear opening is just 2 layers of tape essentially that come together over your paper...the sticky is all exposed in the rear and if it even catches the smallest hair or dust...helllllllo permanent bubbles on your so-called laminated paper.Now, using this thing...no heat, so no plug (the only YAY for this thing).  There is a handle on the LEFT side that you rotate slowly in a clockwise direction as you manually push your paper through the back.  The idea is that those 2 sheets of tape will adhere on top & bottom of your paper and pop out the front looking all laminated...and a simply swipe of a razor blade (which is safely contained) will trim the edge leaving your machine ready for the next job...nice theory Scotch.  1st thing, what percentage of the population is right handed versus left handed??  I\\'m not really sure and don\\'t really care but can say that being right handed I would have preferred that handle to be on the right side since the rotation of that is the most important part of the process.  Getting the rotation timed just right with your other hand pushing the paper through is VERY important...and in my hour of trying this thing, darn near impossible!Your papers will 95% of the time come out with bubbles and 99.9% of the time have creases, sometimes severe creases.  You can sometimes work the bubbles out by taking a soft towel or something similar and rubbing like your life depends upon it...or sticking a needle in the middle of the hole and also rubbing til you sweat to smooth it out.  The creases...yeah, they aren\\'t going anywhere so learn to like them if you get this machine.  If you are lucky (and it surely is luck cuz this thing is not predictable) and happen to get a paper to come out looking rather good...take a picture because it is probably the last.  As with all laminators, you need to trim the edges, but don\\'t trim too close (needs 1/2\" to remain adhered together) or the ends will unstick and then your paper looks even worse than when it first came out of the machine (who woulda thunk that could be possible?).  EVERYTHING that comes out of it needs to be pressed/rubbed to get it all stuck together because the built-in roller that is supposed to do that is a joke.I will give Scotch one thing...the roller is super easy to change and comes in a glossy or matte finish.  I haven\\'t had the luxury to try the matte finish...but with the hair that I have pulled outta my head in the past hour, don\\'t think I\\'m gonna be giving it a try.  For smaller objects (like ID cards), good ol\\' tape across each side and then trimmed works a heck of a lot better than this...is cheaper and takes less time.

The tabs are transparent so you are just reading the titles through the actual tab. It\\'s different but nice. It\\'s really easy to create and print these out. You can simply go to the Wilson Jones website and input your info there to print out or you can follow the easy-to-follow directions included with this set to do this in Microsoft Word or WordPerfect. Not only can you print out the Title Page for your tabs but you can also print out a Table of Contents that goes in the front of your binder behind the included protective cover.These dividers work great in any size binder.  The title pager holder has a section that unfolds when you are using binders greater than 2\".  This makes the titles extend further so you can read them at all times regardless of the binder size.  This is a really helpful feature.I find this to be a very durable set that you should be able to use over and over.

When the gimmick that's supposed to make the product makes the product outright unusable, the whole thing is an utter waste. For the price, I'm even more furious.

It also tears easily with the dispenser it comes in.It is good and sticky. The glue didn't wear off at all.\", \"I got through laptops quickly, and stands as well when the laptop changes.  My previous laptop I got in Jan of this year, was a Lenovo Helix, which only opened up so far (the hinge had limiters in it because the top comes off in tablet form so it couldn't open much past about 110 degrees or so).  In April I got the Thinkpad Yoga, which can flip around 360 degrees, so I wanted a stand that would place it higher off the desk in my office, more in line with the second monitor I use.  That way I didn't have one nearly on the desk and the extended monitor up on the stand.This seemed to fit the need, since it allows for a pretty high screen on a laptop if the screen can open up that wide.  And it does, and I would have loved it and given 5 stars, except that when the laptop is set to be raised to that high of an angle, you can't get it anywhere near flush to a wall or anything behind it, because that foot extends back.  So you're only able to get about 6 inches or so from the edge of anything, which puts this, in my layout anyway, at too weird of an angle compared to the stationary monitor in the corner.It works well though if that isn't an issue for you.  The rubber on the bottom edge does a great job of keeping it in place, and the angle is quickly and easily adjusted with a simple thumb screw.  There's no wiggle, no rattle, and nothing at all to get in the way of ports on your laptop.  It even has a couple slots in the back for cable management if your setup allows cables to run straight out the back of the foot.All told a nearly perfect product for me, 5 star build quality but for my use, only 4 stars for usability in my circumstances.  But still better than the shallower one I replaced that I used on the Helix that couldn't open the screen very wide.\", 'This is a good quality foot rest. It is made of sturdy material and sits firmly in place without moving on the wooden floor where I use it. I would imagine it would do the same on a standard, plasticchair mat. I does exactly what I need, lift my feet to take pressure off my low back.Highly recommended.', 'I received this product free for review and was eager to try it. As a teacher and Educational Therapist, I sometimes have items to laminate and it would be very handy not to run to Staples for this purpose.The laminator is small, lightweight, portable, has a carrying handle, and takes up a minimum of space even though it can laminate something as wide as 12.5 inches. These are definite pluses, since this is not something I would want set up all the time. It is easy to store, easy to take out.I found the instructions confusing. For example, the laminator does both cold and hot laminating, but nowhere does it explain why one would choose one or the other. Also, the laminator came with a package of laminating pouches. Apparently there are different kinds of pouches you use depending on whether you are doing hot or cold lamination, although the instructions do not make this clear. But the package did not indicate what kind the included pouches were. So I tried them first with cold laminating, only they did not fit the instructions for cold lamination because there was no \"protective sheet\" to peel away as the instructions indicated. So apparently they are for hot laminating. It would have been helpful if the pouches had been labeled as such, and if the instructions made it clear that you needed to use a specific kind of pouch depending on whether you are using the hot or cold setting, so I did not have to figure this out by trial and error. Maybe they could have included both kinds in the package. There is also a little instructional chart indicating the steps for usage in pictorial format, but it does not clarify things.The above problems are things that one could adjust to. And once you have sorted through the instructions, it is actually very easy to use. However, I was disappointed with the finished laminated project. I positioned the pouch perfectly and it passed through the laminator without shifting position, jamming, or any other problem. And yet, the finished product was somewhat wrinkly, as if it had heated unevenly, and had numerous bubbles under the surface.This is not a laminator I would use for something I cared a lot about, such as photos, important documents, or your child\\'s precious artwork. For more functional purposes where aesthetics don\\'t matter, it does an adequate job. It is very handy to have, and I will probably use it for charts, flash cards, and other simple jobs. However, it unfortunately won\\'t be able to eliminate my trips to Staples for jobs where looks really matter.', \"I oftentimes work on my laptop in the middle of the night and I know it's not a good idea to rest it on a bed.  So I was hoping this device would make it less likely for my laptop to overheat.  And it would have.  But, I don't like the angles I have to use to be able to take advantage of this lift.Perhaps my husband will get better use out of it for his ipad.  We'll see.\", \"I bought this printer in April of '08. It died today Oct.17, 2008. I'd be much more upset if it was my only printer. Have not been happy from beginning because of problems with paper handling. Must use rear feed for anything other than 20# paper. Rear feed hard to use and inadequate paper guide leads to many misfeeds. Gave up on using front tray after a month because it kept jamming with it's limited use. Today I got messages there was a paper jam when there wasn't. Mechanisms began to sound horrible and print awful, then my paper did jam and won't clear.A shocker a month ago: ran out of ink in one color. the printer then refused to do any printing at all and wouldn't even let me scan or fax when my task didn't need to use any ink.I'm done with it. I don't even want an exchange if they offered it. I'm going back to HP and Brother.\", \"As an avid pen collector for over 10 years, I can honestly say that I was very disappointed by the InkJoy 700RT. For how great they look, how attractive the concept (inspired by grand piano!), and how massively advertised they are....they are a below average pen for the price. I don't know what Paper Mate's secret advanced ink system is, but it just doesn't work. Right out of the package, most of these pens will write lines that feather, the ink will leave little spots, and sometimes it stops working for no reason. Though when they do work, they do write very smoothly...but the performance is so inconsistent that it just isn't worth the struggle. The only reason I am giving this two stars instead of one is because I like the sleek barrel design and the effort Paper Mate put into advertising. I love seeing pen advertisements. Call me a weirdo.Seriously, I would rather use a BIC crystal (cheaper, much more reliable) or even a InkJoy 100RT (the cheaper pens in the same line) than the 700 RT. For fancier pens, I would recommend Paper Mate flair, the new Sharpie pen, or the classic Pentel R.S.V.P. You can't go wrong with those.\", 'I wish I could give these pens a good review - I think they are so nice looking, they have a good grip, and I like how they write.

They're great for bookmarking technical books by subject, but really limited by the color selection.

Bic calls these pens \"fine point\" but the writing is quite clear and easy to read on the page. The black ink lasts for months--unless you write a lot with these every day in which case they will last a shorter amount of time.The pens are compact and easy to carry with you. The pens are made of plastic with an ink tube inside them; this makes them easy to carry because they are so lightweight. As nerdy as it sounds, gentlemen can easily carry one or two in their shirt pockets. I would keep the cap on, of course.Actually, I would keep the cap on at all times when not using this pen. The ink still inside the pen can dry out rather quickly without the cap being on them. Moreover, you don\\'t want ink to leak out of the pen and make nasty ink stains.Overall, if you want an inexpensive pen that still gives you high quality writing ink, you can\\'t go wrong with these pens by Bic. I have used them for decades with great satisfaction.I highly recommend these pens for anyone wanting an inexpensive but good quality black ink pen.', \"Clean set of rolled paper. core was a bit warped but totally usable. what can i say, its a roll of white paper. can't really say much else...\", 'Amazon either recommended or sent this CLI-8PC to me in error and, although Amazon\\'s description of the product includes the personalized assurance that the cartridge will fit my Pixma IP4200, the Canon site begs to differ.  I\\'m begging to differ with Amazon\\'s judgment on this one, and sending it back in exchange for the CLI-8C, which is the cartridge I\\'ve always used and which Canon and Amazon can at least agree is compatible with my printer.  An instance of too much helpful coaching. (All I\\'d like to know is what the blazes does the \"P\" stand for?)', \"I purchased this little machine about 10 years ago. I really needed one for a few quick labels. It was cheap and since I didn't think I would be using it for a long term I would try it. I did buy several replacement tapes at the time ( I was positive I would not be able to get any in 6 months) Well it is at least 10 years, The machine works as well as it did new and labels are still available. If I had a need for one I would not hesitate spending what they are asking for this one. A trick I've learned  is to run the front of the tape gently across your thumb and a dull knife then flip the label over and with a bit more pressure run the tape on the paper side. Like curling ribbon, but not as much pressure. It works like magic. Any stiff, smooth, straight edge will do. If you are in need of one of these I highly recommend this one. I have gone through about 25 tapes, the cutter still works like it is supposed to. I'm not sure how many labels you can get out of a refill but they seem to last forever. I just popped the last one in my machine, so I am replacing my stock. I will only buy 2 this time because they seem to be available. I will look to brother the next time I need a machine that they make. I am no longer angry about the 6 month old typewriter I couldn't get a ribbon for 30 years ago lol.\", 'I bvought this Laminator on one of Amazon\\'s \"Daily Deals\", and have yet to use it, but at the time, we thought we had many uses for it.', 'I received this printer in mid-October through Amazon\\'s Vine program. I am only just now writing my review because we could not get the scanner driver to install on my computer no matter what we did. (It installed fine on my husband\\'s.) Epson wasn\\'t any help. By coincidence, I got a new computer last week and lo and behold, the scanner driver installed. I have Windows 7, 64-bit on both computers, so that really didn\\'t make any sense.I\\'ve tested most of the all-in-one\\'s features. A few are impressive but with all the problems this thing has, I wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone. I am donating mine to the Salvation Army or Goodwill.Scanning:~ Scanning to USB is nice, and it was the only way I could scan when the driver wouldn\\'t install. I was super impressed with the quality of a picture I scanned to a flash drive and then loaded onto my computer for editing. Very good quality scan; it even picked up details in black clothing.~ Scanning into Photoshop, once I could get it to work, was also good. The scan matched the original print very nicely.~ There are several scan interfaces based on what type of user you are, if you are scanning through a software program like Photoshop. I chose \"professional\" and it gave me options that a general home user might not understand. I was glad to have the extra control.Printing:~ General everyday printing is good, typical for an inkjet. It\\'s not as crisp as a laserjet and the ink will smudge, but for general printing, it\\'s fine. If I were printing business documents that needed to look professional, I would use a laserjet.~ Colors print nicely on regular paper.~ Photo printing was ok, but it consistently skewed slightly yellow. Also, typical with inkjets, it does not do a true photo print. You will be able to see, when viewing the print from an angle, the color blocks from the ink. A true photo printer does not do this and the print is seamless, but on an inkjet, it will not blend the ink completely. I would only print on photo paper with an inkjet for throwaway snapshots for kids\\' school projects. For anything you want to frame or give as a gift, use a dedicated photo printer or have it printed by a lab.~ It takes a long time for it to print a 4x6 photo.~ When I took the photo paper out and put regular paper back in, the printer screeched horribly as it printed. I thought it was going to jam. It slightly misfed the sheet because I didn\\'t get it fully into the tray, but wow, I thought the machine was about to break.Faxing:~ This was the big test for this printer. We have VOIP, which is phone service through our cable modem. Most faxes cannot work with VOIP and the product information for this printer warns that it may or may not work. We were thrilled when a fax went through on our test, but when I needed to send a fax another time, it would not work at all.Copying:~ It does a decent job copying, nothing noteworthy there.Autofeeder:~ Every time I tried to use it, it would misfeed or jam. It\\'s flimsy and total crap.General:~ The digital interface is terrible. It\\'s not intuitive, and once you figure out what you need to do, you can\\'t get back out of the menu. It will tell you you\\'ve chosen an invalid option and it just beeps at you. The only way I could exit the fax menu was to select the copy menu or just turn the unit off and back on.~ If you leave it on, it will do self-maintenance every day to clean the print heads, which sucks up ink. I leave it turned off, but then when you do use it, it will clean the print heads automatically.~ I have used it very sparingly for the past four months or so, and the black ink has only 1/4 of it left. The yellow ink has 2/3 left, which is surprising since the photos print a bit yellow. There\\'s less than half of the cyan and magenta.Last night, my son was printing a class report to this printer since he had a color photo in it. The first two drafts he printed were fine. After his final edits, the photo printed without any cyan ink. I thought it was out, but I checked the ink levels today and they were fine. I printed a photo from Lightroom, a photo editing software, and it did the same thing...no cyan ink. Then I printed a photo using the print function in Windows Explorer, and it printed fine. Huh?! The first one was bordered and the second was borderless, but that shouldn\\'t have made a difference. After reading reviews on here, I\\'m not even going to bother with Epson support, especially since they were useless on the scanner driver issue.Since it will cost $40 to buy all four ink cartridges, the auto feeder is crap, the photo print quality isn\\'t good enough (and I have a photo printer and another scanner), there\\'s no compelling reason for me to keep this thing. It\\'s noisy, wastes ink and isn\\'t as good as the HP Photosmart C3180 I was hoping to replace (that one doesn\\'t have a fax or auto feeder). I wouldn\\'t use it as my regular printer like those users who are unhappy about the cartridges lasting only for a month with regular use, but the fact that it won\\'t print at all if any color is out is seriously not cool.To the donation pile it goes! It\\'s a shame. Had they invested more on quality control and had developed a better interface, it wouldn\\'t be such a pain to use or expensive to keep using. It has potential but it ain\\'t there yet.', \"I've tried all the cheap brands and Avery is still the best when it comes to these labels. They print cleanly and smoothly without jamming in the printer. They also adhere solidly to the surface which is important.

Good stuff.\", \"Got my file folders out of the tub, where they've hidden for years, and into the light of day.Perfect for me!\", \"I'll get to the pros and cons below but want to start of with my first impressions.Size...Its a lower profile and more compact than I expected, one of the few good things this printer has going for itself. The ink cartridges and the boring tri color and single black. HP inks are super expensive, replacement color is $30 and depending if you get the XL or standard black refill its another $40 so that's already $70 bucks for another 25 you can buy a new printer. HP inks in my opinion run out way too fast and when its one of those tri color singles one color always runs out before the others which is such a waste. I much prefer the separate ink tank colors like the Canon or the Epson has (listed below).There's not much going on in the option and button department in this printer. Some may like that because its super easy to figure out with the number pad, power button, stop and print, ok buttons. The lcd which is a terrible 2 line mono uses small triangles to indicate what mode your in ex. copy, scan, fax. The overall style of the printer looks dated to me. I'm not a big fan of the paper tray sticking out of the front. The sheet feeder on the top feels junky and have a feeling it will break easy. Its got a glossy black finish and is already full of finger prints, I recommend leaving the plastic film they ship it in on in certain spots to avoid prints and scratches.Pros:-Size, its a nice smaller printer that is easy to fit on a desk or shelf.-Fast printing-Quick scanningCons:-No wifi-No ethernet cable included being its a wired network printer-Terrible LCD (2 line mono)-Bare minimum options-No card slots-Expensive replacement inksConclusion:For the same price you can get the Epson 610Epson Workforce 610 Wireless Color Inkjet All-in-One Printer (C11CA50201)which has wifi connection, separate ink tanks, media card slots, 2.5 in color lcd screen, and much more!!So my final thoughts on this is pass on this series of all-in-ones, it just doesn't have the goods for the same price that others do with all the bells and whistles.\", \"You can get 13ml of ink in the XL, 44% more than the 9ml in the regular 211.

Out of the 352 reviews I only read the #1 rated ones, to see what was said. Several people said people on the other end cannot hear well. I immediately tested mine, and called 2 friends, who both said they could hear me quite clearly. It is funny how there are always people who harshly criticize products in these reviews, yet so many other people do not find anything wrong, I wonder how that can be, can there really be such a big difference between one unit and another. I thought I would like the Black color best, and it cost less than the White, but I see now that the Black shows finger print smudges very easily. I will be keeping it on my bookshelf for use during power outage.', \"This device takes a signal from a wireless headset like the CS540 and lifts up the receiver from your base phone unit. Depending on your phone's angle and the conformation of the receiver, it may work or not. My phone is a Toshiba digital phone and I was able to get this to work only by angling the phone almost horizontally, which makes it look stupid on my desk and also makes it hard to read the LCD and caller ID.Installing it is a bit twitchy, as you have to temporarily mount it somehow on the side of the phone as you play with where it is to sit, and if it's angled correctly. That's because the stickum adhesive is pretty permanent, so you have to decide the optimum  placement before you attach it. I had to resort to duct tape for this step.I'm going to be frank and say I have a love-hate (maybe mostly hate) relationship with Plantronics equipment. I go through headsets lately like nobody's business. My first one lasted 10 years! That was excellent. But the next one lasted 2 minutes (an M22) which only lasted that long because I tap danced on it before I threw it in the trash. The latest is a CS540 which I will review once I have one that doesn't arrive DOA. That's right, dead out of the box. I got it overnight shipped, only to diagnose a bad cable from receiver to amplifier (which will take a week to get replaced.) Nice! Overnight emergency turns into a tech job for me, plus a week's wait. I put all this stuff in the review, because I'm not sure Plantronics deserves their top spot in telephone headset and accessories. We're pretty much stuck using them and I see the quality going down over the years. This lifter is case in point; it's not the swiftest design imaginable. The little extender rod/gripper that is your last-ditch method to get your receiver to hang up is a kludge, in my opinion.

The snap closure really makes the whole concept fall flat - it really does have to have the zipper around the whole thing to serve its purpose.

The legs on this are pretty heavy and it makes this copy holder awkward to move around easily.

The scanner seemed ideal and the reviews were good. You don\\'t have to connect the scanner to a computer (unless you want to). You can put an SD card into the scanner and just plug it in & start feeding photos into the scanner. Awesome! It scans pretty fast - about 20 seconds to scan & save the photo. You can scan at 600dpi and it just auto saves to the sd card. Once you have a lot of photos scanned, you load the sd card onto your computer and do what you will with the scans. The perfect scanner for my needs.Except for the large white lines, through all the photos.Nearly every single photo I scanned had one or more (usually more) long white vertical lines running thru the resulting scans. I tried cleaning the scanner with the little brush, I ran the calibration strip thru the scanner, I dusted off each photo before scanning, I tried using the little plastic insert to hold my photos. I called pandigitial support - they said it was dust being trapped on the scan head. I told them I was dusting my photos off and most of them were very clean & had no visible dust. They offered no solution.No dice, still half or more photos had white lines, basically ruining the scans. I researched and found this is a very very common problem with this scanner. I am surprised more people haven\\'t run into this problem - or maybe they are more forgiving? I was tempted to just \"let it slide\" I mean after all, this scanner is a HUGE time saver. But if the resulting scans are marred with long lines that show up when printing or viewing - what\\'s the point? If you are going to spend $$ on this scanner, which isn\\'t cheap, and take the time to organize and scan your family photos - why not do it right?After the first scanner had the white lines, I returned it to Amazon and bought a second, same make & model. Same white lines. Either I got 2 bad scanners in a row or this is just a problem with this scanner. I have since ordered a Canon flatbed scanner from Amazon that is supposed to have some fairly automatic scanning software. I know it won\\'t be anywhere as fast as the pandigital, but I am hoping I won\\'t be sacrificing quality for speed.', 'I think this is one of the worst printers that I have owned in terms of consuming ink. I hate the fact that it uses so much ink in so little time and that you cannot print anything out if you have a full black ink and no color ink. This printer locks up even though want you would want to print is only black. Kodak used to be affordable at ten bucks a pop but I guess times change.', 'If you like professional and uniform looking labels - and I do - then this is a great product.  I have a P-Touch label maker that I have used forever to create labels for my file folders.  Rather than hand-writing, I print the label, then peel the adhesive strip to the file folder and I do like that my labels have a uniform look.  What detracts from this system is that my labels are printed on white, so once adhered to the file folder, the label as well as the text is clearly visible.  What sets the Avery labels apart is that the label itself is clear.  Thus, it is virtually invisible once it is adhered.  This adds a very professional look to the labels, in addition to the uniform look.However the reason I said in the title that they are best for business use?  The label sheets can be run through your printer which will print the whole page at once.  Prior to their arrival I didn\\'t think this would be a problem, as I could just print a few, then save the sheet and next time I needed labels, print a few more.  Nuh-uh.  The sheet can ONLY be run through the printer one time, due to the adhesive residue on the page that will gum up the printer.  This means I need to know ahead of time what labels I will need for all 50 labels!  Now granted, if I were starting a new project of some kind, that wouldn\\'t be a problem.  But generally I need to create only a few labels at a time - and I don\\'t want to wait months until I have 50 labels that need printed!  For this reason, I downgraded my rating to a 4.The software templates available online make it easy to create the labels.  You can even add a graphic, such as a logo, to the label.  When I saw the suggestion that you can print a label for both sides of the divider at once, I could not at first see how this would be useful.  However I now realize how handy it is to have both sides of the divider labeled.  Now, no matter where I am in the binder, I can easily flip to the section I need.  (This feature means I only have to wait until I need to print 25 labels, instead of 50, before printing the whole sheet.  It also means I go through twice as many labels.)Another nice feature is that rather than having to peel and stick individual labels, it is easy to label a whole strip of five at once.  You simply line them up, stick down the labels, then when you remove the \"outer\" strip, all that is left is the labels on the dividers.The dividers themselves are flimsier than I would prefer.  Thicker than paper but not as rigid as a good cardstock.  The corners are sharp rather than rounded.  So far this hasn\\'t been a problem, although I can see them getting turned over and creased more easily.  The hole side is reinforced and so far has held up well.Overall this is a good product but I do believe its best application is in a business setting where multiple labels are frequently required.', \"I bought this all in one HP Officejet for my son and his wife for Christmas and from day one it had issues.  The printer finally bit the dust yesterday and I have to return it to Amazon.  Very unfortunate as  now I have to order another three in one but it won't be an HP printer.I have two printers of my own and I have not had issues with them but I won't chance another HP printer if there are going to be issues like this with a brand new printer.

For me, I find that college ruled helps me to write much neater, and of course you get more on the page.  What I liked about this product the most was the pockets.  The pockets are made a bit better than some of the others I have had in the past. What I did not like was the perforations in the page were not made well enough to tear the page out easy.  I still had to fold on the perforated line and tear out very gently to get a clean edge on my page.

Unfortunately, when we printed our first 4x6 photo we knew immediately that something was wrong since the colors were extremely blotchy and it took the ink several minutes to dry.I tried changing every printer and quality setting I could find, then it occurred to me that the problem might be the HP paper.  I was skeptical, but I figured I would buy a pack of this paper just to test the theory since it is fairly inexpensive.Anyway, I know it sounds crazy, but this paper completely solved the problem and we're getting beautiful prints from our new Epson Artisan 710 printer!  If you're planning on using HP photo paper with an Epson printer; take my advice and give it away instead - then buy some of this Epson paper for awesome results!As far as the quality of the paper goes, it feels just like the paper used by professional labs.  It also has the right level of gloss to print photos that are sharp and colorful.I highly recommend this paper for use with Epson printers.\", \"This printer replaced a Canon all-in-one that I loved, but is no longer available. This one prints OK but is really noisy and kind of slow. Print quality is fine, I think the ink consumption will be all right judging on what I've used so far. I haven't done any color printing to speak of so I won't comment on that. Hooking it up as a wireless network printer was simple.Scanning is very slow compared to my old Canon. The ADF works well and it does give you the option to add more pages to a PDF file. The copier works fine.It has 3 paper sources, which was a big selling point for me as I use different types of paper for various tasks and also print checks. That's about useless. You can only put one sheet of paper at a time in the rear feed, which was where I had hoped to print checks from. Half the time when I try to use it with one sheet of paper, I get a 'paper jam' error and have to go through all the rigamarole of pretending like I'm clearing a non-existent paper jam and start all over. I've folded that thing up and don't use it at all. You have 2 cassettes in the front, which each hold a ton of paper - that's a plus. It defaults to the top tray, which is the one you have to push the output tray in to access. I am forever forgetting to pull the dang thing back out so it's spitting paper all over the floor. The bottom tray works, but you have to select it every time you want to use it and it is twice as noisy as the top tray for some reason. I print some invoices on half sheets of paper. Not with this printer. It sucks them in sideways. If you attempt to use the paper alignment edges in the paper tray to feed it straight, they center up your half sheet and it only prints half of your invoice. I will have to redo those invoices to suit this printer. Not real happy with paper management.For no apparent reason, it frequently stops printing in the middle of the page, sits and thinks about it for a minute, and then spits out your half-printed page. You then have to go and cancel the document and start over. It does this to me on almost a daily basis. If that weren't irritating enough, this morning I'm printing away and it stops in the middle of the page (of a multi-page document), a pop-up comes up and asks me if I realize that I'm getting low on ink and would I like to order some. After I check the leave me the heck alone and get back to work box, it spits out the half printed page, and I have to cancel the document and start over.I am using this for a home business and I will probably use it for awhile to justify spending $150 on it, but I would never buy another Epson printer. I'm going back to Canon, I don't care how much ink I go through - time is money and it makes my dogs uncomfortable when I swear.A footnote: When looking at the 4 1/2 star rating, bear in mind that there are twice as many Vine Program reviews than there are unbiased reviews from people who actually purchased this printer.Changed my review to one star. After giving up on the wireless network, there is no improvement in printer function. I never go a day without getting an error message and having it stop in the middle of a print job, spitting out the half printed page, and requiring me to cancel the print job and start over. I have been attempting to print holiday newsletters printed on both sides with photos. I can't begin to guess how much high-end paper and ink I have wasted with this boat anchor today. It also told me I was low on ink so I thought to replace that cartridge before starting the next round of printing to avoid more mysterious errors. It refused to allow the carriage to move to the center position for cartridge access. Another reboot and more swearing.\", \"The board feels very cheap--cardboard back and plastic frame but the worst part is that it won't stay on the wall. We use the adhesive strips and it keeps falling off.

As a matter of fact, its surface has antimicrobial treatment so it resists bacteria that cause odor and stain.But the tapered shape makes the wrist rest not very comfortable to use for a prolonged period of time. There simply isn't enough rest for the wrists. I really wish 3M had made the surface a little wider where the wrists actually rest.In the end, I think this wrist rest is decent and most likely will be durable, but I can't recommend it for people who type on the keyboard for long periods of time. If you don't type much, then it can be a good wrist rest to have.\", \"I've found all kinds of uses for this: It's strong enough to hold up a3'x2' corkboard, apaper towel holder, surround-sound speakers, not to mention art and other light wall-hangings. Sure, most of those things could be more easily attached by drilling holes in the walls, but I live in an apartment with a please-don't-put-holes-in-the-wall clause in my lease. I'm sure I'm not the only one.With this super-sticky stuff, I can easily attach (and detach) those items without causing any damage to the walls. No other two-sided tape I've seen (even the3M Command strips, which are great for posters) is this powerful. That mounted items can be so easily adjusted and removed on-the-fly is a huge plus. This is an extremely versatile, useful and inexpensive product.[Update: At the time I posted this review, I hadn't yet removed any of the adhesive strips from the walls. When I did, the adhesive pulled much of the paint off. So be warned that this is very strong adhesive; it's not wall-friendly like the 3M Command products. You'll have to repaint your walls after using these strips on them.]\", \"This is a great investment for preserving any sheets of paper you don't want to get lost or messed up.

But the main problem you may have with this is the fact that you have to label the tabs with a pen (or a printout). I guess you could place a paper sticker on the tab, but it was more for you to write on it. And it you use an erasable ink, then it will come off on your hands. If you use a permanent ink, then you won't be able to change it later.So knowing that, choose wisely. If you'd like to be able to change the titles on the tabs over time, this is probably not the best one for you to use. For everyone else, this will work well.\", \"The 747 is a classic Swingline stapler. Its metal construction is very robust. Although it does have a plastic strip on the top and a rubbery grip on the bottom, it has far more metal than other brands. This stapler claims to staple 20 sheets, and it does that cleanly. With other brands, the maximum stated number of sheets is often an ideal figure but doesn't necessarily represent a mixture with heavy paper.I compared this to aPaperPro Prodigy Desktop Stapler, which coats about twice the price and has a 25 sheet capacity. The PaperPro took decidedly less effort to use. The Swingline was by no means difficult, but the PaperPro works with literally the touch of a finger. With 14 sheets of paper, both stapled cleanly and the PaperPro was the hands down winner. When it came to 20 sheets, which was far less than the maximum capacity of the PaperPro, I expected the same results. But I got the opposite. The PaperPro was still easier to use. But only the Swingline stapled cleanly and consistently. The PaperPro often left the top of the staple sticking out by as much as an eighth of an inch, often bent,  and stapled cleanly a bit over half the time. The Swingline was able to handle 20 sheets cleanly 100% of the time.The Swingline uses a more traditional mechanism and it shouldn't be a problem for an adult to staple 20 sheets while holding the stapler in one hand. It should work fine on a solid desk too, but on a flimsy tray or card table, you will get the feeling that you are better off holding the stapler than trying to push down with your palm to staple 20 sheets. For smaller children, I might still recommend a PaperPro for ease of use, provided that it's not overloaded. Swingline makes anOptima 70 Desk Stapler, Reduced Effortwith a similar design to that one, but it gave me poor results when I tested it in 2011. Children might still prefer aSwingline Bling Fashion Stapler, which will be no problem for a typical number of pages used by a student.The bottom line is that for a good price, the 747 gives you something durable, robust, and that works consistently without any gimmicks.\", \"Works fine.

They work fine.But have you tried their older cousin, the classic BiC Cristal Stics (and I mean *classic,* like 1959 classic)? They are cheap-looking, ultra-simple pens, so they may not have graced your hand if you (like me) thought that a pen needs to be \"soft feel\" or \"rubber gripped\" to be comfortable. But then you\\'d be (like I was) missing the genius of these pens.The classic BiC\\'s were designed exceptionally, like bizarrely well. And I don\\'t mean in a quaint, historical way. In a modern way -- no, in a *timeless* way -- the classic BiC\\'s adhere magnificently to principles of space, form, structure, density, and gravity. Because of their hexagonal shape, they require minimal plastic while also retaining a surprising strength (try snapping one), and the hexagonal grip points give the pens impressive writing stability. A tiny hole drilled in the barrel\\'s body keeps the air pressure the same both inside and outside the pen. Gravity feeds the thick ink down a tube to a free-spinning ball bearing that was manufactured within a fraction of a micron of accuracy. The result is that when the pen is pressed against paper, the ink slides out cleanly and, well,... perfectly. It\\'s not only one of the most inexpensive pens (less than $1.50 for a pack of 10), it\\'s also probably the most efficient pen, with a single pen able to write over 100,000 words (or about 2 novels). Hopefully this helps you understand why, when describing the classic BiC\\'s, I am comfortable using the word \"masterpiece.\"And hopefully this helps you understand why, in comparison, clunky and over-designed \"soft feel\" pens seem somewhat repulsive.Sorry if I come off as a pen snob.', \"I have been using these labels for several months now for DVD's I have recorded for public access television.

Assembly directions were printed on each box.My seventy-seven-year-old father got bored and assembled one of the boxes while I was at work.  When I arrived home, he showed me how to assemble them.  They are relatively easy except for the top piece, which is slightly difficult.  After some practice, I was able to assemble each of the remaining boxes under three minutes.  Once they are assembled, it's nearly impossible to disassemble them.  They are the sturdiest, strongest storage boxes I have ever used.

With its bright pink color is is easy to track down.However, I think I prefer my old standard black stapler with the flat bottom.  While I give the Swingline R+D department an A for effort to try to find a new look for an old classic product, this really doesn't work that well.  The bottom has a curved design which makes it less stable on desk tops, and easy to fall over.  It was confusing at first to figure out how to load the staples, because the holder pulls out horizontally instead of the top swinging up like on most other staplers I have owned. On top of that I have had more than a few staple jams with this stapler, so for me I think I will stick to a boring looking but more functional desk top stapler.\", \"This is the second time I have ordered form this company.

This seems perfectly-designed for wrapping Christmas gifts that are a complex shape, where the paper needs one hand to hold it down.  It worked reasonably well for me in that respect, especially for very large gifts where the ability to stabilize the package on the table was critical.  However, while the strap that holds the tape in place is adjustable, it is not really made for large hands.  I am a big guy, with large hands, and the strap became painful after only about 10 minutes of use.  I had to take it off after only about 4 packages were done, and went back to a standard tape dispenser for the other 20+ packages.If you are a woman or a man with smaller hands, do not hesitate to buy it.

They even have a tiny foam sponge eraser. The colors are bright, the ink is readable, and it's fun to color-code your whiteboard.Here's the important question: how serious is your white board? If you keep your grocery list on a little erasable board on the fridge or use your white board to write notes on your dorm room door, then these are perfect. If you use your 3x4 whiteboard often for meetings or planning, then you'll be knocking these cuties off the board continually, your colleagues won't be able to read the skinny lines from across the table, and you'll run out of ink.

I set it up wirelessly from the beginning, with only a small amount of confusion. There is a 15 minute set-up period, and it does not come with a USB cord, but, once set up, I have found this easy to use. The quality is excellent.

My level of use was on average once per month to clear the calendar; I'm very surprised it didn't hold up so well.  The same board and eraser I bought for our work break room at the time did the same thing, so I would not put much stock in this eraser to hold up over time.\", \"I use this item daily, and it works perfectly. It doesn't slide around in the drawer, and the buckets are easy enough to get items in to and out of. I would purchase this item again, if the need arose.\", 'This is a fairly big and heavy Epson unit which combines an inkjet printer, FAX and scanner. Fortunately it\\'s wireless so you can tuck it in a corner or in another room from computer. I work out of my home office. I found it easy to set up on my Mac network, and the wireless started up with no trouble. The black and white printing is speedy and sharp, and the scanning works well. I did not try the FAX because I rarely use FAX anymore. The instructions and ease of set up have been improved since last time I installed an Epson product. It even prints both sides of the page. As for color photos, Epson really has perfected that and the output is lovely.However, Epson is trying to convince you that inkjet is the best choice the home office, better than laser. Assuming what you do is mainly black and white printing of text documents, and only occasional color, that\\'s just not so. Epson has worked hard on this model but they can\\'t change the basic nature of the beast. If one leaves an inkjet printer sit for a week or so unused, the inkjet nozzles can clog or dry out. For this reason the printer is programmed to use some ink for \"maintenance,\" ie as a solvent to clear the nozzles when you start it up. According to Consumer Reports, this model uses more ink for this purpose than most others. Also, the advertised page capacity of the ink carts is misleading because it is measured by continuous nonstop use, certainly not how I print in a typical week, and takes no account of the \"maintenance\" dose, which will deplete the color even if you NEVER print color. Then there is the matter of ink cartridge refills. Epson and the others practically give away the printers to capture your refill business, like giving away the first few shots of heroin in the schoolyard. Ink is highly profitable for Epson and works out to about $8,000 per gallon! The Amazon price for this unit is $170 but to replace all the cartridges costs from $56 minimum to $125 if you go for the larger capacity. This is like buying a great little car for only $15,000 - but then discovering it costs $5,000 to refill the tank, and you\\'re only allowed to buy fuel from the manufacturer...If that\\'s not enough, Epson along with other inkjet makers were caught about 10 years back programming their printers to shut off prematurely when the carts were still &#8531; full, and forcing you to buy all new cartridges if even one of the colors was \"low.\" HP actually had to pay millions to settle lawsuits over this scam. Pretty cheesy. And then Epson sued the makers of third party cartridges, so you and I would be forced to buy from the mother ship only. So don\\'t be surprised if you see this unit light up with a \"cartridge exhausted\" messsage and refuse to continue at some point, waiting patiently with its arms crossed while you scoot down to Staples to buy more ink, whether you really need it or not. Finally, suppose you want to print black text only, can you do that with the color cartridges just not installed, or exhausted? No, you cannot. The Epson tech support FAQ\\'s state clearly that filled color cartridges must be in place, EVEN to print only black and white. The $8,000 / gal color ink is used as a solvent to keep the black one running. Gotcha. Checkmate. My one star rating reflects all these factors.Over a few days use I found this unit worked pretty smoothly as advertised, and produced quick, lovely output. However, that\\'s for a few days. Over months or years, this is about as wise as accepting those heroin samples. The only small business which would be advised to get something like this would be one that prints photos every day, such as a real estate agent. If your work is mostly text, stay away from inkjet, any inkjet. For day to day work with documents, you will be better off with a small b/w laser which also scans, such as one of the Brother units. These are about the same price with lower consumable cost and higher reliability, and none of the trickery on the refills.', \"This mat is thin, but seems OK and like it will work fine for the intended purpose, but like many others have reported here, mine has an unpleasant odor.

I go through dozens upon dozens of these things a year, to the extent that cost does matter.  I use them for everything...more about that later.  Secondly, they are college ruled.  I have a real hang up about that and have almost a phobia about using the wider ruled note books.  Thirdly, the quality of the paper is what I want...it holds ink pretty well, are better than some about ink bleeding through, but most importantly, it holds simple old graphite from my pencils.  The white color of the pages makes my feeble attempts at penmanship readable and does not stress my eyes in the bright sun light.  For me, these notebooks are simply work horses.Now if I were setting on the Board of Directors of a Fortune 500 company, I probably would not use these things during meetings (well, actually I would, cause I am me, but most people would not), but as I do not hold such a dubiously exalted position, and it is a pretty good bet that I never will, I need not worry about appearances in that particular setting.I do use these things for everything else though.

I have lists dating back for well over 60 years, many of which I have no clue as to what I was listing or why, but never-the-less, I have my precious lists.  These books are ideal for making shopping lists, chore lists, things to do lists and more.  Having different colors is a big advantage when you are a multiple list maker like me as it helps to organize things a bit.  I also use these to \"write things down\" as I have problems with my memory at times.  I wish I could say that this was because I am getting a bit long in the tooth, but that would be a lie.  I have been forgetting things since I was a wee lad and learned a long time ago that it is best to write things down. I have boxes and trunks filled with old notebooks of things I was an am suppose to remember...never look at most of them of course, but they are there if I need them! I am also an obsessive drawer and these are ideal for making rough sketches and strange designs.I like these thinner 70 page models over the thicker three or more subject ones as I tend to lose many of these notebooks and it is nicer to lose a few pages versus many pages.I must have hundreds of these things filled from cover to cover from my school days.  My children will no doubt have a wonderful burning one of these days.Are these books a pure class act?  Hardly, but they are cheap, serviceable, easy to find and extremely functional.  It has been years since I felt the need to impress anyone with my writing materials (actually, that is a lie also, due to the fact that to the best of my knowledge, I have never felt this need to impress anyone as to the aspect of my life), and I seriously doubt if I will change my way as I have gotten worse about such things over the years.This is a very good buy here on Amazon and it is good to throw a few of these things with your order so you can hit the no shipping fee zone.I highly recommend this serviceable product.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks', \"Based on the picture I thought this would be a package of various cut outs so I could make an assortment of great looking stickers/labels.

If you are laminating an 8.5x11 inch document (printer paper size) it is quite frustrating and not perfect in the least bit.In order to laminate, you must first peel the backing off one laminating sheet (made easy by arrows and tabs) and lay your paper on top.  Then you must peel the backing off a second laminating sheet and try desperately to make the two sheets match up perfectly while the sheet curls and tries to cling (perhaps static draws them together so quickly).  As far as I am concerned, getting them to line up is impossible.  I was not able to do so but got it pretty close one time.  If you do mess the aligning up really badly and recognize it before the two sheets are about 1/2 way together and pull the sheet off it will take the ink off your document and the ink/typing will stick to the laminating sheet.I would only recommend if you need to laminate one or two things a year and the machine would take up unnecessary space in your house.

I tried some of those cheap coloring pencils and they all broke. Now on to regular pencils, sometimes it sharpened them properly (maybe 20% of the time). Other times(30% maybe) it sharpened it, but not enough as the lead in the pencil wasnt properly shaved away from the wood surroundings. Even if you put it back it to sharpen it, it wouldnt. The rest of the time (50%) it sharpened the pencil but too much so one side of the wood was shaved off to much and the other wasnt shaved off at all. I tried various ways of using this machine: not putting in the pencil to hard, putting it in as hard as possible.

But the illustrations on the package show the tabs and the plastic sections being used separated or together.  I can understand using the tabs by themselves, but the frosted plastic sections, alone?  You can use a highlighter on the surface - it takes about 15 seconds to dry so it doesn\\'t smear - but my package didn\\'t include that information.  You can peel the plastic sections off the page and in the short term it doesn\\'t lift the printing underneath, but I have no idea what it would be like trying to pull these off after a month or even a year.I can\\'t recommend this product because I can\\'t make an argument for its use other than to make a quick tab on something.  There are better options that are probably cheaper.  I don\\'t think that this product is going to be as popular as the others in their new series of products.', \"I'm not quite sure how to review these dividers.  They're what you'd expect.  They... divide.  They seem durable, the punched holes are reinforced, the tabs are a good size to be clearly visible, and they come with extra tab inserts in case you can't make up your mind between &#34;Expenses&#34; and &#34;Outgoing.&#34;They will do the job, little troopers that they are.  It's true they're not flashy or showy, but sometimes the homey virtues are the best.\", 'I generally really like Avery templates but they seriously missed the mark here. The paper stock is fairly light compared with similar \"Admit One\" products - it feels extremely flimsy and the tear-off stub gets damaged easily. It feeds through a laser printer with no issues but the end result doesn\\'t look very professional.Getting the template set up is not at all straight forward. There are two numbers on the front of the package - the large obvious one (76154) is not the one you need (16154). When searching Avery\\'s website with this number there are currently six templates available, all of which have a Valentine\\'s Day theme. If you delete everything and just use the grid in MS Word, you can probably throw together something with a fair amount of work, but unless you\\'re hosting a Valentine\\'s raffle, these prebuilt designs aren\\'t very useful.The online design software provided is clunky at best with very limited features. Even the design featured on the front of the package would be very hard to reproduce in any of their software. As an upside, you can add QR codes and barcodes, but you can\\'t increment a number on each ticket very easily. Considering these are built for raffles and entry tickets, this is a major problem since you will likely want a different number on each ticket. The other consideration is that these are very easy to copy so wouldn\\'t be suitable for many raffles or ticketed events.Overall I wasn\\'t very impressed with either the paper quality or design options. For ticketed events we\\'ve managed in the past, we\\'ve used a website called admitoneproducts that sells rolls of heavy, card-stock numbered tickets for around $4 per 2000. While these aren\\'t customized at this price, they look much more professional.', \"I've been using these Prismacolor Premier Soft Core Colored Pencils for a couple of weeks now.  I am greatly disappointed with them.  They're difficult to sharpen evenly, even using Prismacolor's special pencil sharpener.  Much worse is that the lead has been broken inside the casing on every single pencil in the set, causing long chunks of lead to drop out of the sharpened end.  This has happened to me at least twice with every pencil.  I'm pretty annoyed at having spent almost $73 on what is supposed to be a premium product; in fact, I find Crayola and CraZArt pencils to outperform Prismacolor's in every circumstance.  What a huge disappointment ...  I would not recommend this product to anyone and I regret having purchased them.\", \"It's a cute little stapler, and very light.  The style is whimsically cute, especially for a woman's desk.  Beauty doesn't mean function, though.I had issues with staples jamming with this stapler.  I could staple several times, but then have it jam and kick out a staple that didn't cut through or curl under the paper.  And this was with perhaps 2-3 sheets!  The other issue I had was that I couldn't put a sleeve of staples in if it was broken in two.  If I did that, the mechanism inside that provides tension actually buckles the back set of staples up into a tent  or worse, kicked it under the front part of your staple sleeve, disrupting stapling.\", \"Be aware, that thing doesn't have self adhesive. it is a bad thing to have to use your lips or tongue to sealed it! and it is a bad too to use external source of adhesive tap each time u use it. avoid and seek the ones with self adhesive\", 'For years I have used clear packing tape to laminate tags and even whole sheets of paper, so I thought this item would be pretty useful. Wrong! It\\'s so difficult to prevent bubbles, creases, and outright jams from occurring that I was better off with my roll of clear packing tape.I liked that it was electricity free because I could take it anywhere and not need to find an outlet, or bring an extension cord. It is a lot better smelling than the heat-type laminators. (That melting plastic smell is awful in a closed office.)  But those are about the extent of the positives. It just doesn\\'t work very well. You feed your item to be laminated into the machine and start turning the roller (which is on the wrong side of the machine for most of the right handed population). The tape cartridge has tape on the top and bottom which (is supposed to) evenly stick to your item and get pressed together by the rollers as it feeds through the machine. Heaven forbid there is a speck of dust, or animal hair, or lint, anywhere near the machine because I guarantee it will end up stuck between your freshly laminated document! The thing is a dust magnet, and the tape cartridge is not well covered to keep it clean.Then, most of the time there will be air bubbles and creases in the finished product which you need to use your fingers or a cloth to try to smooth and press out. A pin hole stuck in the middle of an air bubble helps smooth it out. This is just too much effort for the finished product. And make sure you leave a 1/2\" of extra tape on either end when you use the trimmer. Otherwise the tape starts to peel apart and the document is useless.If all of this wasn\\'t bad enough, the replacement tape cartridges cost nearly as much as the whole unit. Granted they give you a pretty generous 90 feet, but it\\'s still a big investment for a product that doesn\\'t really live up to it performance objectives.I would say stick with the heat laminators as they work a lot better than this dog.', \"I don't have anything bad to say, it works well, it does what it is supposed to, but it is a mouse pad.

More recent models can open wider and will probably work just fine with this stand. This original review was written in 2008 when that was not the case.I bought this for my 17\" MacBook Pro. I currently use a Griffin Elevator at home and I wanted something to use in the office. This looked like a nice stand for a great price. It is a nice stand but does not work for my MacBook Pro at all.1) The stand is sturdy and should hold just about any laptop with ease.2) The mesh is nice if your laptop needs ventilation.3) The design of this stand is that the front of your laptop sits low while the rear end tilts up at an angle. This puts the display at a much higher location than normal, thus keeping you from bending your neck to view your screen. The problem is that when the base of your laptop is placed at this angle your display needs to tilt back VERY FAR in order for it to be vertical. My display did not open wide enough and so when I place it on this stand the display is tilting forward and thus is harder to read than if it were just sitting on the desk.I\\'m sure this works very well with laptops that open wider than mine which is why I gave it 3 stars. However, I couldn\\'t give it more because it is unusable with my machine (and many others like it).', \"I just needed this to organize clutter such as note pads, discs for my computer, take-out menus, tape, etc. This is slightly larger than I expected.

That's good because there is no dispenser or serrated edge with this product. I am a little concerned though that the ease of tearing will result in a box popping open during transport. That led me to use more of this tape as compared to other, more tear-resistant, tape when sealing boxes.

I have been fairly impressed by several Samsung products I purchased recently, so I was very eager to get the chance to try out this new Samsung Color Laserjet printer. First off, I am tired of ALL inkjet printers, because the cartridges are two expensive, and even when you do not use the printers, the cartridges go bad and have to be replaced. I have been wanting to move to a home laserjet for some time to allow me to print documents with some color without the expense of the inkjet cartridges.After giving this printer a workout, I must say that I can rate it as \"acceptable\", but nothing more. My first difficulty in getting it set up was that the paper tray is poorly designed. It serves as the bottom part of the printer. I found it very difficult to get the paper tray back in, since it does not have well designed \"guides\". I had to fumble with it for five minutes to get the tray back in. Hopefully with time I will learn the \"recipe\" to get the paper tray to slide back in properly. Second issue with the paper tray is that it has very limited capacity. It holds only a very thin stack of paper.The next issue I had was that it took me three hours to get the printer installed. In the end, I found that the Samsung supplied USB cable was faulty, and the cable was causing the installation problems. When I replaced with one of my own cables, the installation was done in under 5 minutes. My question for Samsung . . . why include a junk cable? Either provide a quality cable, or dont include one. This bum cable cost me an afternoon.With the printer up and running I did some test prints. I found the overall color on photographs to be subpar by color laserjet standards. The similarly priced HP laserjets provide better color on photographs.The printer does an acceptable job for text, and text with charts and graphs, but somewhat less than acceptable on photographs (yes, I understand laserjets are not made for photos, but I have had other laserjets with better photo capability).So, overall this printer is OK for a cheap color laserjet, but keep your expectations in check if you order it.UPDATE: 4/5/2013I have had this printer now for several months. I have used it very lightly . . . maybe once or twice a week. I was shocked to see that already it is telling me to buy a toner cartridges. It is looking like this printer is going to be WAY more expensive than even an inkjet. The toner cartridge cost is terrible, and toner cartridges are hard to find.I am downgrading my rating from 3 stars (acceptable) to 1 star (not acceptable)The other issue I have found with this printer is that it is FREQUENTLY losing track of what IP port it is on.

My recently deceased Canon MP760 all-in-one scanner would output 48-bit (i.e. 16/channel) color depth, and my Photoshop CS2 software handled it just fine.  It never occurred to me that a more-expensive and three-year-newer printer would not do the same.  You have been warned.', \"I  don't have anything negative to say about this product or my buying experience. It came on time and was exactly what I was looking for.

I liked the idea of getting another option to organize my files and boxes.  As promised, these labels are easy to work with and easy to remove without any residual residue.  There are 4 color options of Pink, Blue, Yellow and Green and the palette though pastel is not so light colored that they aren\\'t noticeable.  You can print your labels using either laser or inkjet printer -I have laser.  The label was crisp in the lettering.  They are very versatile, you could use this to label binders, folders, inventory and even storage containers.  They are also the right size to use as ID badges at an event, since they are color coded you could use one color for sales staff, another for accounting, another for information systems and so on.The only drawback I observed occurred when I placed it inside my personal diary (I don\\'t have a blackberry) part of the edge covered the opposite page covering the crease.  When I opened it up, the page that had the label\\'s edge portion had the 2\" edge peeling away from the page.  In an instance, where it might be to large to fit one surface say on a smaller binder (the labels are 2x4), I could see where it may pull off since it is so easily removed.  The options would be to cut the label down so that it lies on the flat surface and to try to avoid corners, if the edge of the label doesn\\'t go very far beyond the corner.  For instance, if you had it on a box edge where you wanted one label to cover two sides it may be best to place the label\\'s center on the edge, so that both sides are equally covered.  Or another solution might be to cut the label in half to and place it on two sides to avoid the corner altogether or just use two labels.This issue alone doesn\\'t seem a reason not to buy this product; I would definitely use it in my home and office.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 4/12/12I hope 3M improves these labels, they do not stick well.  I would use a Post It, before I use these further.  They fall off and then you don\\'t know which box it belongs to because there are multiple labels on your floor!  I started taping them on, which was exactly what I didn\\'t want to do.  However, at the time I had no other label on hand, I had to keep my records organized.I gave them a revised 2 stars because of the colors are different than what other competitors are using.', \"This Padfolio has served me well through out several jobs and internships.

Is there anybody who doesn\\'t know what this is?On the other hand, this iconic product could use a bit of updating.Pros -- Matte finish, so it \"disappears\" on paper (even more so if you rub it with your fingernail). It also won\\'t show up as much on xeroxes (oh, excuse me, \"photocopies\")- Two-sided clamshell dispenser. Cheaper tapes have a one-sided dispenser, and yes, the open side of the tape gets cruddy. You wind up with a dark line on the edge of the tape. These are better.Cons -- The greener alternative to this package would be one refillable dispenser and a bunch of refills (at least for a home office). Scotch does in fact make a desk dispenser package with refills (Scotch Magic(TM) Tape Deal), but the dispenser is clunky and big. I would totally go for a slightly more robust version of this dispenser instead. I do recognize, however, that most people are going to use up the roll and throw the dispenser out. So...- There are only 18 yards on the roll. That\\'s ~650 inches, not the 1000 inches in the refills (Scotch Magic Tape). Shipping these with the full 1000 inch rolls would also be a greener alternative - it would mean 1/3 fewer dispensers thrown away, and about 1/3 less energy used for packaging and shipping. I\\'m sure, when these dispensers were first designed, some marketing guy figured out the price point and decided on 18 yards. But that was decades ago, and consumers think differently now.Great tape. Needs a packaging upgrade[Update - on Earth Day, 3M announced a green alternative to this tape, namely a tape base and glue made from renewable materials. They also have started a dispenser recycling program (the dispensers are polystyrene, which most local programs won\\'t take).

I removed three stars from my rating for the misleading/unclear product description.The product lost an additional star for the single handle as opposed to more useful double handles.  I get it; the box handle is designed to help you pull it off a shelf.  But, this product would have much greater versatility if it had handles on both sides.The measurements are clearly stated in this item's description, so I knew how big it would be, but it may be worth noting that it is smaller than the lidded Bankers Box file box that I am used to seeing.Lastly, the packaging on these was ridiculous.

The ink cartridges and print heads are hidden inside the printer. It's a miniature easter egg hunt to find the pieces you need. Then, of course, the ink cartridges don't quite click into their slots as definitively as you might hope, so that takes a bit of trial and error. Setting the printer to work when connected to the computer takes a while of watching the software work, but is pretty brainless. Getting it to work wireless is a process full of mystery and confusion. I followed all the steps, and it didn't work because my computer couldn't detect the printer, even after the printer itself had found the wireless router. Annoyed, i went to lunch, and when i came back, my computer could detect the printer. So, eventually it got it to work, and i don't exactly know how (i have a degree in Computer Science, by the way).Once everything's talking to everything, it's great. My only complaint is that i keep opening the whole printer instead of just the lid to the flat-bed scanner. It doesn't break anything, but it is annoying.The touch-screen is responsive, and the icons are big enough that adult fingers can hit them reliably. The almost-one-touch copying/scanning is handy.Ok, apparently i lied, i have another complaint: scanning to your computer is handled very strangely. Instead of just scanning to jpg or pdf, as it does when you're scanning to a USB drive or memory card, it scans to an application. Not only is that strange, but it's opaque. There's no indication on the scanner itself of why, for example, scanning into Preview (on a mac) will produce a TIFF while scanning to photoshop will produce a jpg. It's so, so easy to scan to a USB drive, i wish i could just tell the printer to dump a PDF on my desktop. When you do scan to your computer, you can choose to 'scan to file', which opens up a window on your desktop (on a mac, at least) that lets you choose the format, but that's still several steps more than it should be.There are little perks, too, like the microfibre cloth to clean the scanning glass, and a USB printer cable (no printer i've participated in unpacking in the past five years has had a cable packaged with it, until this one which, ironically, is wireless-capable).--Updating after many weeks of use: I'm beginning to wonder if my printer is possessed. It turns itself off after being idle for a while, which is great. Now, though, it randomly turns itself on as well. And yesterday, a new quirk: it turned itself off in the middle of printing, causing a massive paper jam. Now it's printing fine again, but it grabs each new sheet of paper with such force that it crimps the center of the top edge. I've fiddled with it to no avail. I'll be calling customer service when i have a chance.--Updating after many more months of use: Suddenly, my printer stopped printing PDFs. It popped up an error message that exists nowhere that google can find. I updated my drivers and the printer's firmware, but that didn't work. Then i tried the online chat tech support. The first agent i got suggested i uninstall the printer and re-install it. I did. It still didn't work. So he said i should do it again. I ended the chat, and started a new one. This time i got a different agent who was actually helpful. They ended up having to do desktop sharing to fiddle with all of the settings, eventually setting up a special PDF preset that actually prints. So after 2 hours, they didn't fix the problem, but did give me a kludge to at least get by. Thus, i subtract one more star due to horrible, horrible tech support.\", 'This is what you get from a company that can\\'t even hire one designer or drafter to make a sensible product.

I was really excited to try them and was expecting professional results, as is the case with most Avery labels.Unfortunately, the instructions inside the packaging (the outer packaging does not declare this) reveal that these generally won\\'t work with black ink. The instruction sheet makes such declarations for various printers as: \"Use color ink cartridge only.\" \"Use any color but black.\"  Black ink, which is what my printer has, sits on top of the labels and doesn\\'t soak in. It eventually dries, but the text dries a lot thinner than intended, isn\\'t very legible, scrapes off, and isn\\'t color-fast. For anyone who just uses black ink cartridges, I recommend choosing another Avery label.Using someone else\\'s quality printer, one with archival and color inks, I printed out sheets using dark blue ink. The ink dried and the results looked professional, but the ink also scraped off, especially in any large print areas (thin printing is more difficult to scrape off), and isn\\'t color-fast. If you have a high-quality color printer and want to use the labels, here are some things I learned from the instructions and through trial and error: Use a dark color, but not the black ink cartridge. Choose fonts and images with thin lines (they seem to be more difficult to chip off). Let the ink dry for a few days prior to use. Finally, if you want added security when shipping, place tape over each finished label.I have used these for shipping purposes after putting tape over the label, but wouldn\\'t use them as-is when shipping mail or packages, due to the lack of permanence. Non-archival-quality, temporary craft use is a possibility, however, such as to/from gift-wrap labels. They really are pretty labels, but the success of printing on them will depend greatly on each individual printer.', 'Pros:- Unit feels solidly built and has some weight but not so much as to be inconvenient to take on travel.- Buttons have a nice solid feel to them when pressed.- Lots of good auditory feedback in the system:= LED light blinks when charge is low.= Audio feedback (beeps) when you adjust volume level. Different beep sound when you have reached max volume.= On max volume it is sufficiently loud for a small conference table.= LED blinks when searching for Bluetooth connection.= Additional LED lights up when muted.- Supports both USB and Bluetooth audio.- Unit includes a USB cable and an attractive faux wool case to protect it when taken on travel.Cons:Testing on my MacPro laptop:Audio output quality in Bluetooth is much better than with the USB connector. With the USB connector the audio sounds garbled as if it wasn&#699;t sampling enough.Music plays quite loudly over Bluetooth and for the most part does a good job, but do not expect a Bose! On the other hand audio output at voice frequencies appear to be very good. So clearly they are trying to optimize the frequency response for the intended use.Testing on my iPhone5:Audio input using Bluetooth seems to be an issue. When I test it with an audio recording app the recorded audio is decent. However when I engage in a phone conversation using the default iPhone phone app, the remote participant complained that they were intermittently losing parts of what I was saying, so I tried toggling back and forth between the built in mic on my phone and the philips to determine if the problem may be due to  \"cellular\" transmission problems. The philips seemed to be the problem.When I get a chance I may try out the other permutations.  But for now the device does not appear to be very effective.I began testing it again recently about 2 weeks since I wrote the review and now the microphone has ceased to work entirely.

It installed in under 5 minutes on both Windows XP and Windows Vista (I have it installed on two machines).  It prints VERY fast and is reasonably quiet.  The print quality is outstanding, even using the economy mode to save toner.  For a home office or general home use, this printer can't be beat for its price.  It will save the average user hundreds of dollars in ink costs.Note to users who want to do double sided printing:I like to print double sided to save paper and in order to consolidate some of my larger print jobs.  I've noticed that double sided printing wreaks havoc on this printer... I'm not sure whether its the toner or the printer itself. In any case, after you print several pages double sided the printer fails to produce high quality prints no matter how many times you run the cleaning utility. Instead you get lots of debris and extraneous black spotting on the paper. So, I recommend you steer clear of double sided printing.\", \"I was forced to buy one of these for tests.

Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs free at our town's community day (sort of like a street fair) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use.  CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs.  For the 250 bulbs, we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $15,000.  There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.Avery Address Labels were a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee's name.  The question was how to get the information printed on the labels.  At the Avery web site, I found free software, DesignPro, which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes.  I downloaded the software easily and got started on the designFor the labels, there were about a dozen pre-made templates for the different size labels.  I chose the template that matched my labels.  Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint.  I was able to cut and paste a graphics image, add the appropriate text, and choose a font for the text.  A test run on my printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels.  The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up.  I can never remember.  After an up/down test, I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.Our community day give-away was a big success.  Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours.  We were able to peel the labels from the printed sheets easily. There was enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs.  One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways.  The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before.  I am now a big fan of Avery labels, but I recommend getting the free software to make them work.\", 'In about a month from now the back-to-school ads will appear.

This thing is so thin that pushing standard thumbtacks into it will not only go completely through the board, but into the wall behind it as well. My now perforated wall aside, the composition of this board is horrendous. In only a few months it&#8217;s been used between me and my brothers to the point where chunks of cork are falling out of the board. As my bro found out, taping anything to the board is not a good idea, as the cork peels right off with the tape. Also, that &#8220;oak&#8221; frame is really plastic, and the only other material reinforcing this thing is cardboard. Dropping this from extremely low heights is a sure way to bust that framing too.

My only major complaint is they do not allow you to bundle together multiple images into a single document.However, I would NOT recommend most users to buy this.When it comes down to it, you are paying $5+ for each pad which contains 40 sheets.

After finding the scale's software (not at the location in the manual, but it will get you there - look at the bottom left of the page) a window appeared on my Mac that faithfully shows what is on the scale itself, but that really isn't helpful. I could just as easily remember the information from the scale itself -- in either case, I would have to enter it manually. The user manual talks exclusively about Windows and Internet Explorer. It also does mention Firefox, but I went to the USPS website with Firefox (not my regular browser now) and the scale was not sensed.So this scale currently is pretty much useless with Macs. Presumably it's okay with Windows, but I did not test it. I did test the accuracy of the scale and it is good. The scale looks well-constructed and is small and convenient. I'm hoping to find it useful once it supports Macs.UPDATE 1: Ironically, when I finished writing this review I went back to my desktop and the scale's software, which had been idle, had hung up. I had to use Force Quit to close it. That really doesn't mean much, I suppose, since the software doesn't really do anything.\", \"I have several friends who are servers at my favorite restaurant.

She\\'s been frustrated with cheap inkjet printers that never work for her (she prints so infrequently the cartridges clog or expire); I wanted something I could setup and forget about.

So far, I\\'m pleased.But it does include spyware - or at least \"nagware\". The standard installer adds a \"reminder\" utility on the sly. It pops up every two weeks and recommends buying printer supplies. True, it comes with an uninstaller and one can turn off the reminders without uninstalling, but it is fundamentally marketing software installed without my awareness that provides me no benefit. By some definitions, that\\'s spyware.It is hard for vendors to resist the temptations offered by an authenticated installer. I gave the printer 4 stars instead of five for that little trick. After you install your HP 1012, uninstall the nagware.Other than the nagware, there\\'s not much to complain about. This ought to be an \\'install and forget\\' light duty printer.

The principal reason being that it is wrinkled. The plastic outer cover/pockets is wrinkled as it the white plastic that coats/covers the cardback backing.  Solid it may be, but pretty it is not.The white of this notebook is not snow white. It has an every so small touch of yellow.\", \"I've tried my best to revive this printer from the dead.  I've wasted so much ink and had so many issues that it's simply impossible to begin on what is wrong with this system.  I've used Kodak ink, compatible ink and swapped them back and forth to no avail.  The system simply will not print or copy as it did when brand new.True, the ink is very inexpensive but with the quality of the system so cheaply made the inexpensive ink is hardly worth the cost of having to buy a new system in less than 2 years. I've run the maintenance, aligned the print heads, changed the ink and still I have no usable printer.  What I have is a very large WiFi paperweight that needs to be tossed in the trash if not picked up by Kodak.It's a shame the system went south.  For the first year it printed great, had great quality but it slowly started to print erratically, and the crispness faded out as time went on.  If someone offers you this printer, even if it's free it's best to avoid the headaches since your print quality will be hit or miss.  Kodak used to stand for quality, today - not so much.I'm very disappointed in this system and do not recommend it to anyone.\", \"I WANTED to like these pens...but I didn't.PROS:- Writes with little effort- Bold inkCONS:- CLUMPS of ink like crazy!

Annoying in a hurry!So overall, sorry, but I wouldn't recommend these pens to anyone...there are hardly an 'inkjoy' to write with, due to the clumps of ink they leave constantly.  Why not take the time to test these products more before bringing them to market?  I think these are just old pens dressed up in new fancy jackets.\", 'Excellent binder which has 2 side pockets to put things in.  There is extra space between the rings of the binder and the binding itself so it closes beautifully.  It is virtually indestructible and will easily hold 500 pages.

This makes them very easy to store or kepe on desk but you have to handwrite them. Also, I found that they tend to stick together and you have to be careful peeling so you only get one.  There is also a tab at the end to tear off but often tears the label when you do so and is stubborn to remove.  I used them for some home office work and they were fine for that or if you were a student they would be easy tocarry around and label folders with but they would leave something to be desired in a professional office.', \"Okay, it's $1.30 marble book.

They did not snap together easily. It wasn't obvious how to pair them and it took me a couple of tries to get it right. Even worse when I tried to move the boxes, even though I was not holding them by the handle, they came apart. They might be nice if you won't ever move or use the box, but then why bother?They are said to fit most cubby systems and their sides are sturdy.

However, the security markings are poorly done and information is easily read when holding the envelopes up to a light.  The tamper portion works as expected for the most part, but what good does it really do if the contents can be read without doing anything to the envelope itself?  For the price and quantity you receive in combination with these issues, the envelopes are not worth it.

They are really quite lovely.  But they weren't as absorbent as I had been expecting.  Still, they are pretty and since I have a uterus function is immaterial.\", \"Sanford Major Accent with orange ink is a large highlighting marker that produces a nice, bright orange color that is easy to see and that doesn't hide the text underneath. It doesn't soak through paper, either, so you don't need to worry that the paper underneath will become dotted with orange ink. The ink in this highlighter sticks to the spot it was intended to cover and even the act of making additional strokes over the same area won't cause it to soak through to the other side. As long as the ink on the paper that one wishes to highlight is dry, there won't be any smearing or mess when using this highlighter.One other nice thing about this highlighter is its lack of any offensive odor. Most of us have experienced the nasty smell that seems to radiate from many different types of markers. This highlighting marker contains no such smell and this is a nice change for those of us who gag upon popping the cap off of most markers.The highlighting line produced by this marker varies in length depending on the way it is angled when it touches the surface of the paper. The chisel tip is good for making wide lines and this makes it a good choice when a large amount of material needs to be highlighted. Angling the tip another direction (to get the thinnest line) will result in a line that is about one- third as wide (when compared to the widest possible line). This ability to produce lines of varying width is another one of the highlighter's strong points.If there are any negative points to make about this highlighting marker they would have to be the lack of a gripping area near the tip of the marker and the possibility of stained clothing. No gripping surface means the marker can sometimes slide between the fingers. It can also produce stains on light colored clothing but the stains can usually be washed out since the ink isn't as permanent as other ink markers. The ink dries within seconds of contact with a porous surface but since its mark is so light, it won't even be noticeable on darker clothing.Overall, Sanford Major Accent with orange ink is a very good choice for highlighting paper and similar materials. It makes lines of varying length, dries quickly, and doesn't have a bad smell. It's a good highlighter to have around when you need to make wider lines and want a nice, vibrant shade of orange.\", 'We just replaced an older AT&T 210 corded phone with a new one because the sound on the old one had become difficult to hear.

The call comes into either cell phone, transfers to the Panasonic KX-TG7643M dect 6.0 Link-to-Cell Bluetooth Cordless Phone just like it is supposed to, but then about 90% of the time, the Panasonic handset drops the call and says I missed the call.  However, I have found that when this happens, I can grab either my blackberry or Motorola cell phone, depending which one was being called, and I can answer the call on that device.  This seems really strange since I answered the call on the Panasonic unit only to have it drop the call yet find the call is still active on the cell phone that was being called. Both cell phones are relatively new and should be compatible with the Panasonic KX-TG7643M dect 6.0 Link-to-Cell Bluetooth Cordless Phone.Since the main reason I decided to buy the Panasonic KX-TG7643M dect 6.0 Link-to-Cell Bluetooth Cordless Phone over a few other brands I looked at was the stated ability to link it to a bluetooth enabled cell phone and this feature is not working correctly for me with neither of my two bluetooth enabled cell phones, I have to rate this product at no more than 2 stars. If I can figure out why this is happening and correct it, I will update this review with the solution.Update: Have not been able to fix the Panasonic dropping my cell phone calls. another thing users need to be aware of is the fact that this Panasonic phone can only store/chain up to 24 digits when programming a number. Trying to store my calling card access number and caller ID pin, I need to store a number that is 26 digits long, so another negative feature to this phone. My old AT&T; base unit, which this Panasonic was to replace could store 26 digits, so I may need to go back to using that phone unit. Perhaps I will give this Panasonic unit away to a family member or friend who doesn't need to store long phone number combinations or want to have it connect to a bluetooth enabled cell. I will leave the rating at a 2 stars since the unit does receive land line calls.\", 'We have used Canon scanners for 20 years in our business.

It's not hard, though, and for its ease of use and its portability I would recommend one of these to any student or scholar on a budget.\", \"I feel bad giving these low marks.

I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD), but when you print or go to print preview, you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label, particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution, but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out.\", 'I bought this for art journaling and found them hit or miss as far as what they will write over.

It is the top that is the one problem.  Since the box quite long in relation to its width, the middle part of the top opening is a point of structural weakness, this is compounded by the fact that the two folding lids do not completely cross over the top of the box and have only a 1&#34; overlap.  If something heavy and not as wide as the box is set on top the lid will bend inwards and open.Because of this while these boxes have securable lids, the cords on the ends are very secure, they are not all that secure.  A lidded Bankers Box with a string and button fastener on each end would be preferable.  In addition since the box is a flap top it is harder to access files than in a box with a removable lid, making these boxes really only useful for storing archival files.', \"First of all, the instructions (and I use that word loosely) on how to put this together are horrible.  There was no way I could figure it out by looking at the pictures; I had to fiddle with it until I figured it out on my own.  You need to unscrew the legs, which are heavy because they're filled with sand, and then slide them on the appropriate sides.  After the legs are on then you'll see that the holder can be adjusted either forward or backward.  Then the elastic slides on each side and also can be adjusted up or down.I know this is advertised as a document holder or copy holder, but the reason I wanted it mainly was to hold knitting or crochet instructions and charts and use the elastic to show where I was in the pattern, and it works perfectly for that purpose.  But I have also found that it works great to hold my iPad up so I don't have to physically hold it.  It is larger than I thought and you need a lot of space on your desk or wherever you put it.

I *really* wanted a pencil sharpener that didn't need to be plugged in, that the kids could use (they keep stealing my cosmetic pencil sharpener which is just a small little thing.  I wouldn't mind except it doesn't catch the shavings and then I have to hunt for it when I need to sharpen eye or lip liner or whatever.)The only way I could sharpen a pencil with this was to open the front cover, take out the batteries, and apply counterforce to the blade as I sharpened the pencil.(runs on two double A's but chews through them fast.My hubs was sure he could get it up and running but we decided to stop when the motor started to smell like something was burning up.Disappointment!  I would have bought one for everyone if it had worked well because the kids are always complaining about not having pencils- they have plenty of pencils, just can't find a decent thing to sharpen them with.  I know you can get plug-in units that work decently- we had a behemoth from like 1970 for ages but it finally gave up the ghost.Anyhow, I could have received the ONE pencil sharpener that as soon as you removed the covering to empty the non-existant 'shavings' the plastic housing would start to come apart.  It sure made a heck of alot of noise like it was sharpening a pencil- kind of like my kids cleaning their rooms- but nothing ever actually got done without me, literally, keeping my thumb on the thing and using it like a non-electric sharpener.It does look small and sleek.  Woo!  I.e. this will make a decent paperweight if you need some non-functional piece of office equipment to take up space(even if it a small space).\", \"When I first tried the stapler, I used about 50 magazine pages as a test. The stapler jammed. It continued to jam each time I tried it with anything, even when I was down to two pages. I called ACCO customer support, and after describing the issue they told me to return it or exchange it. I opted to return it. Although it's possible that mine was an exception, the part that the staples come out of was not properly aligned with the recess on the bottom plate, leaving nothing to get the staple to bend on the bottom.A positive point is that it comes with a lifetime guarantee against jamming when used with the correct (included) staples. I can't say how likely it is to jam, but if yours stops working after a while, you always have the option of calling customer service. They answered on the first ring, which is a plus.You might also consider thePaperPro 60-Sheet High-Capacity Stapler (1200), which has a capacity of fewer sheets (60) but works reliably and with very little force. Hopefully, the distribution of reviews will give you an idea of how well it works, under what circumstances it fails, and what remedy people had when it failed after owning it for a long period of time.\", \"Although it is extremely handy to have my books I am typing out of on this copy holder, I found two major flaws with it.The first was the sheer amount of space it took up. I found it very ungainly, a pain to move around, and it simply took up way too much space. I couldn't fit it under my computer screen like it advertised and can't imagine it working that way unless your screen could go very high.  So I have it off to the side of my screen; which is less than ideal but works.The second thing that really annoyed me was when I tried to turn the pages. There is a lip on the front of the black base that prevented me from turning the pages easily.  I had to physically lift up the book and turn the pages so that they wouldn't scrape and start to tear on the lip. You wouldn't run into this issue if you are using loose-sheet pages instead of a book like I was, so it depends on what you are planning on using this for.That being said, there are some really great things about this. I love how the legs can pivot so you can stand it up straight or you can lean the book back. That was a REALLY nice feature.  I also loved how you could move it up and down and at basically any level that you wanted. That was another huge plus.  Really, if they had just made the lip in the front fold-able and if it took up a bit less room on the desk I would be VERY happy with it!\", 'I\\'m puzzled by why this was included in the Vine options.

The manufacturer makes this tape with a no frills, no frustration design that makes it easy to seal boxes and other like items.Henkel EZ Start Carton Sealing Tape with Dispenser is certainly different from other packing tape in several important ways. Among the differences, the one you will notice right away is the way the tape releases itself from the roll. It dispenses with almost no effort and no sound. Other packing tapes are more resistant and they come off the roll with a loud, almost painful ripping sound. There is no such problem with Henkel EZ Start Carton Sealing Tape with Dispenser. It comes off the roll with almost no effort at all.Another important difference with this tape is the tearing of the tape. The dispenser does have a nice, handy cutting bar, but the truth is, you don't necessarily need the tearing bar. The reason is due to the ease of tearing this tape. It is very easy to grab an edge, between the fingers, and tear off a piece of tape. Other tapes are tougher and are manufactured in such a way that a metal bar or scissors are necessary to cut the tape, but there is no such need with Henkel EZ Start Carton Sealing Tape.The above qualities certainly set this product apart from the rest, but this tape isn't without its flaws and the greatest among them is getting the tape started. As you grab an edge with your fingernail, the tape slowly lifts up, but if you lift it too quickly, it will start to tear vertically and this is due to the ease of tearing described above. When this happens, you then have to grab the other edge and lift it up, slowly, until the two sides meet. Getting it started takes effort and patience and because of this problem, consumers should always store this tape by having it stretched out over the cutting bar. If the tape is permitted to fall back in place, touching the roll, it will have to be started again, and this could lead to the same problem just described.One other potential problem with this tape is its overall strength. It has no problems when used to seal boxes, but because the tape is so easy to tear, it doesn't have the diverse abilities of other packing tape. With other, stronger tape, the tape is strong enough and the adhesive sticky enough that the tape can be used for a multitude of purposes. This tape can only be used for its intended purpose and little else.Henkel EZ Start Carton Sealing Tape with Dispenser is, overall, a good product and it does succeed at its main purpose, which is using it for packing and sealing boxes. Its performance is satisfactory when used in this manner, but its overall use is limited and there are other, similar tapes that work just as well and for a lower price.\", 'Its new and works well for now but I have had bad luck with shredders.

Then one day I started getting black ink leaking out of the tray where the papers dispenses in front.  I had been using brands other than Canon for my ink and though that had likeley created my problem. I ordered a new cartridge holder just in case and started with a brand new set of Canon brand ink cartridges. Sure enough, today, after working fine for a couple of days the black ink slmost spurt out as i look into the paper tray on the bottom.  It looks like the problem is not the cartridge or the print cartridge holder so it is beyond my expertise to fix it. It would likely cost more to fix than to replace.I do have a Canon MP 620 at my home and it has worked very well. Has a few features that make it a better buy and for whatever reason is cheaper than the 610 which it replaces. Crazy on these prices. I still like Canons and as they often say bad things just sometime happen.

When I finally got one side to slide in and tried to get the other side in, the first side slid out. Happened about 3 or 4 times before I was able to balance it enough to complete assembly.  Seemed simple enough but it was tricky!  Also, it seemed too bulky for it's use and it didn't glide well.  Sometimes it got stuck to the point where it had to be adjusted manually. What a pain!  I got the unit so that it would take the place of my footrest and space heater.However, it just doesn't warm my feet the way a space heater does.  As it only heats the bottom of my feet, I was still left cold and so I went back to using a space heater under my work desk.

But by far the worst attribute is the functioning of the wireless feature.  I have spent so many wasted hours trying to configure it but it has trouble even detecting  the SSID signal, then it loses the connection almost immediately.  I have changed to every possible security configuration including WEP, WPA. WPA2 and so on.  Occasionally the setup accepts the settings and I feel like I discovered cold fusion.  I print something only to be told a minute later the computer can\\'t find the printer.  I scream, \"it\\'s 3 feet away in clear view!\".  Many seem satisfied with this printer.  But I\\'ve conceded it\\'s time to drag the HP out of the attic and learn to live with a wired connection but great print quality and flawless functions.', 'This is a well built calculator that has large keys for folks with large fingers. I would recommend if you have larger hands. Ended up purchasing several for my company due to their popularity. Best large keyed calculator under $15.', 'I read, and placemark books and files A LOT.  Pagemarkers have been a staple item for years.  These particular ones have pros and cons:Pros:1.  Nice bright pastel colors that are easy to spot.2.  Matte finish that is easy to write on with any type pen or pencil.3.  These appear to have a good price relative to the others available (but see below).Cons:1.  Very thin, thus easy to tear, on the upside unlikely to tear the page itself.2.  Not very sticky, which can be a pain when the book is used often and they fall off.3.  Do not retain their stickiness.  This a big downside, since I often move markers to new positions.  These will not stick twice, so no re-organizing.4.  I love Amazon, but it may not be the place to buy small office supplies.  Unless you are buying one incredible amount of stickers, the shipping costs are very high per sticker.In sum, these may be OK when used for archival materials that are rarely used or when used on delicate pages.  But they do not appear adequate for heavy reference use.', \"I'd love to review this printer, but I can't get it connected via wireless or by USB. We've had problems with our wireless connecting to our wireless at home, so we tried it at our office too, but it was a no-go. So then we tried it via a USB connection and that was a disaster. We've reviewed several printers for Amazon Vine so I don't think we did anything wrong in the set-up. Looking at other reviews, I don't want to risk downloading software from the website since they said they got a virus out of it. My advice would be to stay away from this model. There has to be an easier and safer way to get black and white prints.\", 'We purchased these to use at Thank You cards for our wedding gifts/wedding guests.As always Avery products are so easy to use.

My wife bought this for me and added 5 hanging folders with names. Voila, my office is organized and not a heaping mess of papers anymore. I'm happy.\", 'Avery has joined forces with stamps.com to offer this \"starter kit\" for print-at-home postage, and while the box makes big, great-sounding promises: \"Four Free Weeks of Service!\" and \"$45 Free Postage\" ... the fine print reveals some major drawbacks.First, the \"free\" postage. Actually, it\\'s only $5, not $45, unless you subscribe to stamps.com $15.99/month service. And even then it\\'s not $40, it\\'s $10 per month via four separate coupons (my kit had only one), redeemable only via a mail and requiring an ADDITIONAL \"6-8 weeks\" of waiting, FOR EACH. Oh and the postcard must be mailed using an Avery stamp and stamps.com postage, notch. Oh and, that \"four weeks\" of free service? It\\'s actually 14 days. When you sign up, they state clearly they\\'ll charge your credit card for a month\\'s service if you don\\'t call and cancel, \"within 14 days.\"The (ridiculously high, in my opinion) monthly service fee is prohibitive unless you\\'re mailing upwards of $200-$400/month on a regular basis, so that leaves most home users out. Since the postage MUST be printed on stamps.com approved labels, that\\'s another continuing and significant expense, above and beyond the $15.99 monthly fee and postage costs. I also read complaints from people online that cancellation is very difficult (you have to call and get the hard sell from operators) and can not be done online, leaving some with endless auto debits (the only method stamps.com allows for payment), even when they\\'re not using the service.All you\\'re actually getting with this kit is 5 pages of self-stick, printable mailing labels (10 total), 4 pages of \"3-part mailing labels pages\" and 5 stamp pages (20 stamps per page).In short, this is NOT something useful to most people who use USPS simply to send cards, pay bills and mail the occasional package. Unless you\\'re currently making daily runs to the post office and sending 10-20 packages per week, stamps.com service likely won\\'t pay off for you. And if you DO need this service--high volume eBay or Amazon Marketplace sellers, for instance--stamps.com own trial offer (which comes with the same label/stamp printing kit), postage credits, PLUS a 10 lb. USB postage scale that automatically integrates with their system and makes the whole thing MUCH easier to use, is probably a better deal.Again, and only in the fine print, Avery acknowledges a postage scale is required to fully utilize the stamps.com service. The Avery kit claims you can get a 5 lb. postage scale (that does NOT hook up to your computer or integrate with the stamps.com software) by submitting a mail-in form and, \"just pay[ing] shipping and handling.\" My kit lacked said form but I have a sneaking suspicion that \"shipping and handling\" would exceed the cost of the scale in the first place. (You can buy a basic 5 lb. postage scale for >$15 at most office supply stores.)Lastly, the Avery/stamps.com system will only work with Windows PCs. Max and Linux users are out of luck. In fact, the packaging says it only works with Vista, but Windows 7 machines seem to access everything OK too. (Stamps.com entire site only works with Windows running Internet Explorer, making it a web dinosaur. Some areas won\\'t function under Firefox or other browsers. Who under the age of 65 uses IE?)If you do use lots of postage, stamps.com might be a good deal--for instance, you get electronic rate discounts on larger mail items and extra services--but I think there are better ways to use/access the service than via this Avery starter kit. And if you\\'re only mailing things online, there are other places to print online postage, without a monthly fee, including the U.S. Postal Service\\'s own website.EDIT: For some reason, even though the service name and free postage amount claim are listed in the TITLE OF THIS PRODUCT, Amazon.com redacted all references in my review to the service these Avery labels require you to use for postage and the amounts of free postage promised and/or given. I don\\'t get that at all (especially when such things NOT redacted in a previous review) and I have no idea how you\\'re supposed to review the labels when you can\\'t reference the service you must subscribe to use them and the claims made on the packaging.', 'I think $4.99 is expensive for a 1 inch binder.

Having said that, I believe it\\'s overpriced and that it may not be as durable given the fact that it doesn\\'t fully close so that the top and bottom meet.', 'Nothing against this pad compared to other pads like it, BUT in general these soft pads make my optical mouse jump when I am trying to make tiny movements that you need to do when working with graphics.OK here is what I found that works really well (for me at least).

I'll compare it to Panasonic, which has been the go-to replacement phone for years.The styling of the Motorola is much nicer.  The Motorola is thin and light, and also stands upright.  The sound on the Motorola handset and on the speakerphone are both excellent, and match Panasonic.  The range worked just fine, with the sound clear throughout the house, the same as Panasonic.Then other differences separate the two phones.  On the plus side, the Motorola will pair with a mobile phone using Bluetooth.  With Motorola every individual phone can retrieve voice messages, instead of only having the message stored on one base unit.  On the minus side, there is no blinking red light when I get home, so I have to remember to pick up the receiver to see if there is a message.  Motorola also had a delay when pushing buttons, making it more difficult to use.  The Motorola menu also took a little time to get used to.  The battery life on the Motorola is around one third or less than the battery life of the Panasonic.Overall, the Motorola looks great but just does not work well enough to justify the price.\", \"Big enough for all the crumpled paper I have to throw when studying.Feels durable and actually looks nice.Obviously it's made of meshed wiring so throwing dust and liquids into it isn't a great idea unless you put a plastic bag inside the can.Got my money's worth.\", \"Recently I got a newEpson XP-410  Printerand was extremely dissatisfied with the quality of the photo prints. After complaining about it to a friend, he told me to try using Epson's own photo paper (I had used HP paper before). Sure enough, the quality of prints improved dramatically. Since my Epson printer is WiFi AND AirPort compatible, I'd much rather use it than my old HP printer. Which means that from now on I'll be shopping for Epson photo paper as well, and my stockpile of old HP paper has become useless. I may still hang on to it just in case I switch back to an HP printer at some point in the future.The paper itself is very nice. The prints are smooth and glossy, as advertised. They are on par with the prints you'll get from the numerous online photo printing sites, but the exact outcome may depend on the quality of the printer you have, as well as on the ink. I am also not sure how durable these prints are, but since I still have many digital photos gracing the walls of my house that are over a decade old, I am pretty confident that this paper will endure for a foreseeable future.\", \"I've been longing for labels like these. Avery's White Internet Shipping Labels come through for my shipping needs. The solid white paper thick, strong, and opaque which successfully blanks out and covers any old labels found on shipping boxes I may wish to reuse. (I usually pull them off, but sometimes this ends up damaging a perfectly good box.) The adhesive is strong yet it's easy to peel off the backing.  I'm enjoying having a half sheet label I don't need to use tape down myself. Print, peel, stick, and go. The convenience of that is wonderful!I do want share some thoughts and concerns:1. It may be necessary to use extra protection for foul weather. I've accidentally rubbed off part off the ink when trying to smooth off a label which had gotten a bit wet on a rainy day trip to the post office. It was not just the ink that smudge, but a layer of paper peeled off too. It came off a bit too easy which causes me to be concerned about foul weather possibilities when using these labels.2. [...] program I found to be the best way to utilize the two labels on the sheet for shipping. I can opt to print on only one side of a sheet. Similar applications will probably do the same. Paypal prints the receipt on the opposite side, thereby ruining the second label for shipping. (I'm going investigate this to see if I can change this. I would hate to ruin another label.)Concerns aside, I am really happy with these labels and gladly welcome them into my home office.\", 'Worst printer I have ever owned. I will never buy an HP printer again. I read the reviews before purchasing, and they were better than the 2 1/2 stars shown here. At first, it was pretty okay. We never could get the wireless to work.  My husband is great at setting up wireless, computers, etc., but not on this. Since the printer was basically next to my desk anyway, we just used a USB cable.  The print and speed was fine.  The NOISE is terrible.  It seems like it needs to calibrate or something on a regular basis.  That was bothersome.  I probably should have taken it back, but never did.  I had it less than a year and then all of the sudden it just stopped printing.  I looked online and saw that there were lots of people having the same issue.  It was the printer head issue.  So, I was basically done with it.  Easier to buy another one, but NEVER an HP again!  I highly recommend you thoroughly read reviews before you purchase.

The large shaving receptacle allows for plenty of use between trips to the trash.  We really like this pencil sharpener, design, and color.  However, it\\'s not without its flaws.  First, the points on the pencils can be rather short and sharp, like a needle.  The sides of the pencils tend to have a little wood left behind, so you have to put the pencil back in at and angle to expose more graphite.  We do like the automatic pencil stop, so many times with a regular pencil sharpener the pencil gets sucked down for lunch and before you know it you\\'re left with a stub of a brand new pencil! I can\\'t say it\\'s \"quiet,\" but it certainly isn\\'t as loud as a tree chipper, as our older electric pencil sharpener is.Overall it\\'s a power horse of an electric pencil sharpener, quick and seamless.

It is durable and well made, like the other products, but it isn't as flexible in how you use it.  The opaque tab means that it really can only be used to mark the edge of the paper, but the smaller tab makes more sense for this purpose.  If you want to add a note to the page it makes more sense to use the NoteTabs without the tab, since you can place that on the page anywhere.So far I have only used this one to mark a page as I work through the book.  I can't say that it is completely useless, or anything like that.  But for my purposes, it is not very useful.  I do like the other NoteTabs products, though.\", \"After using the disposable Varsity fountain pens, and have some experience with some older models in the past, I decided to make the switch back to the fountain pen.All in all, I'm quite pleased with this pen.

The plastic feel is somewhat cheap, but the overall weight of the pen helps mitigate that.So far my only disappointment is that the ink has leaked to the inside chamber just above the nib.  I've read that happened to someone else, so I'm not sure if that is standard for these pens or not.  I guess if I had gone with a colored pen, I might not have noticed.All in all, a great purchase that writes great on everything I've thrown at it:  post it notes, legal pad, copy paper, checkbook etc.\", 'These for some reason were hard to erase from the board, Not sure why.

Set on a normal desk, its height would be a bit cumbersome to type on, unless you hooked up an external keyboard.Be clear, this *will not* support much weight.

Now however, they do not write as smoothly, the ink flow is inconsistent and it appears ink gathers at the tip so the first time you write (after say a day of letting the pen sit), you get a slight glob of ink.

These Uni-Ball Elite are some of the best rollerball pens that I have used. They write smoothly with very even ink application even with light pressure and nice ink colors. What I like the most is that they are very easy to use and the ink flows easily allowing very fast writing yet with good style. I write very fast and most pens don't keep up well or are scratchy in one way or another but these Uni-Ball Elite kept up nicely even well I was writing as fast as I could and the results were excellent, better than any other inexpensive pens. However, some of the other reviewers commented that the pens were not smooth or consistent so I'm wondering about Uni-ball's quality control.

I suggest anyone considering the MFC-7860DW read the one star reviews.Brother wants you use a USB cable between your computer and the Brother device to set up wireless initially.  The software did not properly set up the wireless network using this method.  I then attempted to use the front panel on the device to configure network settings.  Unfortunately, the software/firmware on the device has problems because it would not permit inputting certain common characters used for network keys.  The manual states those characters should appear by pressing specific buttons, but in the case of this unit, they did not.  The manual is wrong and unreliable.Customer Services acts like you\\'re nuts in believing the problem has anything to do with the printer.  \"Not our problem\" is Customer Service\\'s manta.  \"Must be a router issue.\"  \"Call your router company\".Eventually, I was able to get the printer to work wirelessly only after dropping all firewall protection on my computer and the network.  It worked once.  After the printer went to sleep - which is does often - it never worked again.As I said before, Brother may be a great printer company, but they are a lousy networking company.  If your IP address is 192.168.4.102, the printer believes it\\'s 192.168.004.102.  Do you want your printer to work wirelessly?  Does that mean your computer is connected to the router via wireless, the printer is connected to the router via wireless, or both?  Most people have mixed networks, and the answer makes a huge difference.Brother never through about adding connectivity beyond the first computer.  I assume most people get this printer for it\\'s wireless capability to use with multiple computers.  However, the required software takes you through every single step each time you install it one a computer, even though your printer already has been set up to your router.  Yep, not a networking company.Brother\\'s solution to everything is to delete all network settings and reconfigure them.  This unit goes to sleep every 2 - 3 minutes.

It is not possible to set the privacy mode for just a single handset, it is either all on or all off. Since the phonebook is now stored on the main base unit, accessing it through the handset is slower than in previous models; it takes a second or two to access the missed calls list as well. It should just store it on each handset and then sync it when it needs to. The time on it can not be set to 24hr, only am/pm format.

I frequently had to pick up my mouse and reposition it on the pad or slide my mouse completely off the pad while testing this pad.Considering that I've used free mouse pads that were given away at banks or at the time I purchased a PC that were better than this mouse pad I'm a little amazed that Amazon is selling this mouse pad for as much as they are.Again, if you just need a very basic mouse pad then this does indeed get the job done ... it's just there are a lot of other mouse pads out there for around the same price that do the job even better than this.\", \"The wrist rest is great.

Using the dispenser actually slowed me down, but I think most people would find it useful.I'm thinking it might end up being worthwhile to pay more for this tape, use a lot less, and get a more secure package. However, I gave it only 4 stars because even though it is a top quality product, I don't think it should cost as much as it does.

The ink flows out so readily, and it maintains a steady output until it dies.  But those two features are true of almost any fluid rollerball (fluid rollerballs having a free-flowing ink tank, not a marker-style sponge pressed against the back side of the ball).Aside from having chosen to make a pen in that category, Pilot isn\\'t offering anything special here.  The ball tip is among the crudest on the market, and no description of its construction could include the words \"quality\" or \"precision\".  Much like the BIC Triumph, the V5 ensures ink flow through its poorly-manufactured tip by using a very loose, rattling ball.

After testing a few strips on cardboard, it proved to me that it's better. The old version simply comes away from the cardboard without tearing it while the new version takes off the first layer of paper.  I'm sold.One thing that is most bothersome is the fact that the start of each roll (the dead space that allows you to get the tape started) is not quite at the end of the strip.

Now for the rest of the story.The \"See the Difference\" graphic in Amazon\\'s Product Description is misleading. A good chunk of that larger SuperTab area is below the so-called paper line. Some marketing guru cheated the SuperTab folder on the left &lt;UP> in an attempt to make the tab seem taller compared to the file folder on the right. A truthful comparison would show the top edges equal, the tab on the left thus appearing larger only because its space extends into the domain of the file folder below. In other words, if you use all of the SuperTab area to write in (after all, Smead encourages you to \"write bigger, print bigger labels or have more lines of description\") and then you place standard size paper in the file folder (you would be expected to do so, these being \"letter size\" file folders), you will *not* be able to see everything you had written on the tab. Oops! Did the manufacturer forget to test these, or is the \"SuperTab\" claim pure snake oil? Not only that, it looks worse aesthetically, and offers less privacy, to have portions of documentation showing through.But wait, there\\'s more. Not only is the front of the folder cut to make the tab appear larger, but so, too, is the overall (non-tabbed) horizontal height of the back of the folder reduced: by approximately 3/8\", compared to some other brands (and perhaps even compared to Smead\\'s standard non-SuperTab file folders). Again, the goal is to make the tab area seem larger. The downside of this (and there is no real upside, keep in mind) is that any paperwork which may be slightly wider than normal, or perhaps several pages stapled together sloppily, will not cleanly fit.While the advertising sounds great (90% larger label area), logic shall prevail. Think about it: The tab physically cannot be taller than on other file folders, all other measurements being equal. If it were, the file folder might not fit in the drawer! The truth is that normal paper will cause almost a full inch of this so-called Super-Tab to be obscured (7/8\", precisely), thus effectively halving the usable area of the not-so-super \"SuperTab.\" That\\'s deceptive, and it pretty much invalidates the main selling point of this product.On the plus side, this 100-count box contains four nice bright colors, each with three different tab locations. So that\\'s twelve different choices, which can be useful in organizing. I tend to vary location and color in an attempt to make files easier to recognize and retrieve. These are made in the U.S.A. of slightly (10%) recycled content, and are of thicker stock than my current supply of cheapo store brand (Office Max) file folders.So, these file folders should work fine. They just won\\'t work any better than regular (non-SuperTab) file folders, and I certainly would not pay a premium for these. The only possible way these might be useful (as claimed) is if you are placing smaller pieces of paper in the file folders. But that\\'s atypical for me and probably for most people.Jason Kirkfield, Vine Review, March 3, 2011', \"I had no difficulties running these through our Canon inket printer, and the labels look really nice when you print them.  I picked the gold color to use with our holiday cards for this year, and they look classy and elegant.That being said, it was a pain to deal with the template!  My version of MS Word didn't have the label number built into it as a template, so I had to go to Avery's website to download it.  From there, I tried copying and pasting the addresses I had typed into an old label template into this new one, and it got really wonky on me.  I've done the same thing many times before with other template numbers, so I'm not sure why this one was so screwy. I ended up up just re-typing all my addresses in, and then it was fine, but I wish it had been easier.Overall, this stick well and look nice!\", \"This dispenser holds the tape well and cuts fine but it needs some serious bedazzling and weights on the bottom.

Today two important phones calls were lost because the batteries died in the middle of placing an order for gifts and then in the middle of discussions about my homeowner's and auto insurance.I called the company and they said they were sending me some new batteries.

My printer not only read \"Change Cartridge\" but stopped printing on the white copy paper coming out the gate of the printer.  Fortunately, I had this double package waiting in the wings.  Just time enough for a quick installation.  I wasn\\'t sure whether one cartridge was sufficient or if both were needed.  So I decided to take no chances.  First, the color cartridge went into the left compartment.  Then the black cartridge---except it wouldn\\'t fit.  I was gentle, then rough, then profane, and finally praying.  Suddenly, I noticed a problem.  Canon (or some middleman) had sent me a box with two CL-241XL cartridges.  I had no PG-240 cartridge--and was in position or mood to print out photos of pet pussycats or golden sunsets.I went to the studio trying toremember my introduction and, above all, the order of the downloaded tunes I\\'d burned to disc.  Then I discovered that I\\'d brought the wrong key (dark blue instead of black).  I was locked out, \"Air-less,\" thanks to my own carelessness compounded by an outrageous error by the seller(s).

Nevertheless, for all yee non-believers who are reluctant to trust your fortunes to the Almighty, I issue this cautionary: check on the cartridges you\\'ve purchased as soon as they arrive in the mail.  Someone at the other end appears to be numerically illiterate--and possibly color tone-deaf.  You\\'re paying enough for these as it is.  Make sure you received what you thought you ordered.[It\\'s just occurred to me that the safest bet would be to order a new printer each time you run out of ink.  That way you\\'re assured of getting the right cartridges, and the price for printer+cartridges is about the same as for the cartridges alone!]', \"Geez, I can't believe how hard this cushion is!

Once this is accomplished, the labels can be put in the printer, printer settings changed to accept them, and you have printed address labels. Much quicker than doing this by hand, and they look so much better!', \"Avery labels (the white paper ones) have been a staple at my desk and in my kitchen for years.  I use them multiple ways: there's always the address label for the few snail mail pieces I still send, then there are file folders for the actual paperwork I still file manually, instead of digitally, but it's the other stuff where I really put these to use - they're perfect for labeling Mason jars after you've processed that summer harvest of peaches and figs, I've used them to label bakery boxes of cookies I've baked and taken to meetings (I have a set pre-printed with the names and ingredients of various cookie recipes I bake frequently), they're a snap to slap on a jar or Tupperware container filled with arborio rice you'd like to distinguish from the basmati in the container next to it on the shelf and they make figuring out which computer cable goes to which peripheral a snap.These clear labels are even better than the white ones.  They're advertised as clear - don't expect shiny-clear, like a piece of cellophane tape.  Instead, they've got somewhat of a mildly-milky matte finish, like Scotch brand Magic Tape, that doesn't exactly disappear when applied to surfaces.  That's hardly a negative, however, as they stick much better than the white ones - I'll be using these from now on for Mason jars and other goodies in the pantry.  These also seem sturdier...I expect they'll stand up to wear better than the white paper-based labels.Finally, Avery has done a nifty little improvement to the base papers these labels are mounted on: just a small bend in the paper causes the edge of the label to pop up and makes removing them a snap!  You can easily extract a single label without bothering any of the others.Against truly dark items (do you really mail things in black envelopes all that often?) with dark printing on the label may be the only time you'll need to use a paper-based label instead; the contrast in that situation may simply not be enough to read the label easily.With that one exception, I expect I'll be using these labels often and to good effect.

It is pretty good sized (2 ft x 1 1/2-ish feet) but it is really lightweight so I would say highly portable.  Caution!  I think this could fold/bend pretty easily.Downsides?  This is not an aesthetically pleasing bulletin board (if there is such a thing)- mostly because the frame is so glaringly cheap.  Another problem?  If you put anything slightly weighty on it, you may have problems with it staying on the wall as you will also be hanging it from the ultra aforementioned cheap-o frame.All in all?  If you don't care what it looks like or if it will stay on the wall, this may be the perfect bargain for you.

It can be achieved by placing the axis just under the handle, as in Sparco Compact Luggage Cart, or by bending the handle toward the axis, as in Vestil Steel Hand Truck, or by both, as in Norris 230 155-Pound Capacity Multi-Purpose Folding Cart or Safco 4061.

It almost seemed too good to be true.  After some initial skepticism and subsequent analysis, I realized that it was, in fact, an excellent deal - for a niche low volume user who needs fast printing.As a frequent author of reviews, I would typically check Amazon before buying such an item.  So after returning to my office, printer in hand, my enthusiasm was somewhat dampened by the negative reviews on the HL-1440.  I almost returned it before seeing the print quality and performing some basic calculations.  In the end, I am glad I kept it as it serves my need for having a fast, high quality, low volume printer in my one-man office.Currently I own a [large] microwave-sized multifunction HP inkjet (d155xi), which is at my home office.  I decided that if I needed another printer in a second location, it should be a inexpensive laser printer.  Initially, I thought I would purchase a $300 HP.  My concern with such printers and the other sub-$500 printers was the cost of the consumables. Experience with ink-jets (such as my HP-d155xi) demonstrated that the ink expenditures are a real killer. This, of course, is a ploy by the manufacturers to recoup equipment costs via pricy consumables.The sales associate at Office Max suggested that the replacement toner cartridges last 6000 sheets for around $60. After some mental calculations, I figured that it would be a good deal.  Only when I returned to read the Amazon customer reviews did I learn that there was a second consumable - the drum - that lasts, at best, 20,000 sheets.  This is something I did not anticipate.  While I have no way of determining if this second consumable was created for purely technical reasons or merely as a financial/marketing strategy, I would guess that it is a bit of both.  Moreover, at a cost of $115 w/tax, the drum costs about 65% of the cost of a HL-1440, making a second drum purchase a psychological obstacle.To determine if the Brother HL-1440 was a good value, I opened Excel and performed some basic calculations, which you can see below.Assumptions - Drum replaced at 15,000 sheets first time; 18,000 additional sheets second time.  High capacity toner lasts stated 6000 sheets, original yields 3000 sheets.  Note that it doesn\\'t come with a USB cable ($20) but I had a surplus one.$w_tax  total$  total sheets  _sheetprinter  $176 $176 3k  5.9HC toner 1 $57 $232 9k  2.6HC toner 2 $57 $289 15k  1.9New Drum  $115 $404 15kHC toner 3 $57 $461 21k  2.2HC toner 4 $57 $518 27k  1.9HC toner 5 $57 $574 33k  1.7As you can see, if you chose to toss the printer at 15,000 sheets, the average price per sheet is 1.9 cents. This is far below the cost of printing at Kinko\\'s - excluding transportation costs and convenience value.  The tricky part comes from the decision to purchase a new drum.  It takes a while to recoup the cost of the drum, making it a very tough decision for some. Moreover, one has to guess  how long the other components will last. Given my level of use, I would probably not purchase the drum. In the three years that it would take to wear out the first drum, another, more cost effective solution would become available.Like expectancy issues aside, there are some nice features to this printer.  Print quality is excellent (as least after the first 500 pages). While somewhat lightweight compared to workgroup printers, it is built better than most inkjets I have used.  Nice touches include the paper level meter where a mechanical needle on the front indicates the height of the paper reserves in the tray.Some strange problems include mirror printing from certain applications, such as MS Streets and Trips 2004. This is corrected by a patch.  There is also a recurring \"Found New Hardware\" problem where it creates a new printer icon (Copy 1, 2, etc).  It usually stops at copy 2.  Brother suggests that this is a Windows XP problem. As I have used multiple USB printers on this and similar computers, I doubt that it is just an XP problem.  In the end, it appears that a full drive uninstall may have solved this minor annoyance.In the end, I would suggest this printer is a good choice for low volume home offices or single person companies. If you are like me, someone who prints around a 100 pages per week and needs a fast printer when on deadline, the HL-1440 is a good choice. I would not recommend this for any moderate volume or workgroup environment.Pro\\'sExcellent print qualityVery inexpensiveLow total cost of ownership/price per pageNice paper level meterCon\\'sPoor front interfaceShort lifePossible driver problemsStrange printing anomalies (corrected by patches)Only 2MB memoryNo USB cabled included', 'The Wilson Jones ColorLife Expanding File with Flap, A-Z Index, 10 x 12 Inches, Letter Size, Dark Blue (WCCC7117A-BL) is attractive and has a slot for A-Z.

The Velcro strip is loud when opening. I would not recommend for long-term use. Also, since the filer is a deep blue, it is hard to read the black letters. Neon colors with the black letters would have worked better for the visually challenged. For $18, this is just an okay deal in my estimation.

Thinking this would hold up better than the plastic kind that broke into pieces after a while that I had prior to this. And at first this is great but then I noticed that this began to break and splinter into pieces. Once I contacted the manufacturer and what they didn't advertise at first when I originally purchased is that you have to make sure you buy the appropriate thickness for the type of flooring you have. My mistake is that I purchased a thickness that was not appropriate for the flooring. So if you have a thick carpet with padding and want this type of bamboo mat, make sure you get the thickest version (5MM thickness will not work for thick carpet) of this as opposed to the thinner bamboo mats or you will have splintering and cracking. I will say that it is my fault in this case for not researching but this wasn't originally made clear when I first purchased.

When I work at a desk all day, my body compresses in on itself leaving me with the most horrendous headaches.  So any product that hints at relief is something that I'm willing to try.However, I just don't think I appreciate the advantages of the product.  It is so high off the ground, it feels more awkward then I had anticipated.  You can do some adjustments, with effort, on the angle and tilt--but on height, you are stuck with the limitations of the product.  I'd have liked the unit to have some give so that my feet might be able to manipulate it into a more beneficial position--but it's a big process to make slight and barely noticeable changes.  Trust me, it's done nothing for my posture and I weary of it soon enough--kicking it out of the way after a short while.  The surface is hard plastic and not particularly comfortable if you take your shoes off.  Looking at the picture, it appeared more rubberized (hey, rubber with a little massage action, that sounds nice, maybe that's what I want!).And lastly, there is the heating and ventilation component.  Listen, I don't mind crawling on the ground to turn the settings but some might.  The unit, itself, is plenty large enough--but due to design, only the middle part is connected to the air flow.  So to even take advantage of this, you must press your feet together in the center as opposed to sitting in your own comfort zone.An intriguing idea that suffers from fairly poor execution.  While I may have gotten this product free to review, it is also something an idiot like me might have bought free and clear.  I am the target market for these completely extraneous electronics, and I'm afraid I just don't get this one.\", \"I typically use Boise X9 Bright 20lb paper in both my laser and inkjet printers. This Epson product is ever so slightly heavier. I barely notice it, but for two sided printing, the 24lb paper is an improvement as you don't see the print as easily on the other side of the page. I also notice that it is somewhat brighter in shade and smoother, allowing for the inkjet to do a better job with fine print. For regular black type, the laser still outperforms the appearance of even the best inkjets, but since so much of our work has color these days, it's nice to find an inexpensive solution for at least the paper side of the equation. This is a step up from basic copy paper, but it's not such a step up that anyone will say, &#34;Oooo...nice paper.&#34;Watch for a good price, as the price varies from $5 to $10 for 500 sheets.\", 'Weird smell coming off this mouse pad.

I really don\\'t think it had anything to do with the wireless -- that portion went without a hitch.  After several hours, it is now installed as a wifi network device and labels can be created by Brother software and printed to it by the desktop tower and the netbook.  I\\'ll work on the iPad next.Pro:The labels look very nice.  The label creation software is very full-featured.Getting *the printer* to register wirelessly on the network was quite easy.Label loading is very easyPrinting, advancing and cutting is so quiet that I thought it hadn\\'t printed at first until I found the label on the floor!Labels look pretty affordable; address labels appear to run about 3 cents apieceYou can purchase postage through Pitney Bowes and print it to \"compatible label rolls.\"Con:One bit of small print on one enclosed slick is the only notice you get that \"label printer must be connected to PC via USB for postage printing.\"  That just deep-sixed the convenience of the wireless -- back to printing postage from the USPS siteI had a bear of a time with the installation on the CD/in the Quick Setup Guide, some details below.Here\\'s how I ended up getting things installed, in case it is of help to anyone (I can\\'t really see how it would be, as I mostly just muddled around until it worked, but I\\'ll give it a shot):The provided instructions are next to useless.  I am sure someone worked very hard on them but I did follow them, or at least think I was doing so, and things didn\\'t work.  The instructions in the book and on the included CD say that, even when installing the printer to be used via wifi, you should initially connect it with the provided USB cable.  When the installation was done, the printer was recognized on the network (wirelessly)and the wifi light on the printer was green, but the printer had been installed to the USB-attached computer as a USB device.  For that computer,  I had to uninstall the USB driver and re-install the driver, specifying that it was for a wifi printer, before it would work.  I don\\'t know whether it would be better to try the initial install without using the USB cable, or if you need to do that to get the wifi key into the printer. &lt;shrug>In the meantime, I went hither and yon on the Brother support site.  By Googling \"Brother QL-710W Troubleshooting,\" I found the driver download I needed for the CD-less netbook, and also the label creation software for that machine.  Given that this is intended to be a networked printer, you\\'d think the manual would have a big header saying \"here\\'s what you do for your network devices that don\\'t have CD drives\" and a set of download links for your netbook, your iPad, etc.  Instead, you have to deduce which app to use, and *then* go get the serial number for your printer in order to install it.  Seriously, am I going to be stealing your software to use if I don\\'t have your printer?  If it\\'s a network printer, why would you be restricting the drivers and label creation software to use with it?  I don\\'t get that.Also, if you\\'re going to ship the product with a 40-page printed manual, at least put a troubleshooting section in it, although I have to say the troubleshooting FAQs on the website were of no help, either.', 'Absolute disappointment.

The Print, scan, copy, fax, and wireless functions all sound really great. It has a superb scanner, that works well when scanning to a USB drive and the resolution is superb. The general printing capabilities work well for while, but then they go wacky and replacing the cartridges is a waste of time. When I kept on trying and trying to set up the wireless, I thought it was something I was doing wrong, but I followed the directions and the epson would not connect to the local wireless network , even though every other unit I have connects easily. The Air Print fails totally, and it is very disappointing. Most of the basic printing works well for a while, but then it fails. Overall, if you want a short term printer, that can scan very well after the printing fails ( and you get Fair to intermittent Faxing capabilities that work better with a fax modem).

The only thing &#34;leather-like&#34; about this product is that they printed a pattern on a piece of paper and then glued it to both sides of the folio. I won't reward a misleading product description in any way.Further, they made a design mistake on how they apply the &#34;skin&#34; they think makes it look &#34;leather-like&#34;. There IS a reinforcing material at the bottom corners of the file. However, the &#34;skin&#34; was glued on last, over the top of the corner reinforcement. It won't be very long at all before the glued down paper starts to separate at the corner, either from humidity or general wear. When that happens it will spread, and eventually the file will look pretty bad.I also think that the file should have been made just a touch wider. It is OK if all you want to do is dump receipts and pieces of paper into it. However, should you want to further organize your dividers by putting file folders into it, that is an issue. While you can get a file folder to slide into it, it is not at all convenient to do so, and it has to squeeze into the wider part of the section, where the accordion side is at its widest. If you want to put a few file folders in it, you'll be out of luck. Even making this 1/8th inch wider would have eliminated that problem. If you've ever put receipts into a file like this, and then tried digging around blind in the bottom trying to find and grasp them, you'll appreciate how much easier it is to have them in a regular file folder that you can slide into one of these and then just pull it back out with the full contents.They make the claim that each pocket expands to 7/8ths inch. Maybe in their dreams. Yes, if you virtually pull the product apart to fully expand one pocket, sticking your hand all the way in to assist in flattening out the bottom, you could get it to extend to 7/8ths of an inch. It wouldn't stay there, nor could you conceivably expand EVERY pocket to that width.I've had a similar accordion file from Globe Weiss for years which has a higher quality glossy exterior, IS wide enough to easily slide a file folder into, and has a fold over top which closes with velcro ... to keep you from accidentally spilling the contents of your file should you accidentally knock the thing off your desk.

I did notice the blade was small and recessed and that there was a little piece of plastic on the bottom of the mouse. DON'T REMOVE THE PLASTIC!

A paper jam will take a lot of time to clear. 20 mins of removing tiny shreds of paper through the ink access door is no fun when trying to get work done.The Bluetooth printing does not work with iOS (iPhone or iPad). It also isn\\'t compatible with HP ePrint, so Chromebooks are nearly impossible unless you have another laptop to act as a print server.There is no wifi. Honestly, the best way to travel with this is to bring along an Airport Express.The bluetooth printing works fine with Mac OSX 10.9, though setup took a couple tries (hint: don\\'t try pairing it in bluetooth setup, just stare at the add-printer screen until it somehow will appear, eventually). You can only print one or two pages with bluetooth. If you print more than a couple of pages, the connection will drop and the print job will not complete. If you need multiple page documents, make sure you pack a USB cable (not included).The best solution for traveling with this is to pair it with an Airport Express and USB cable. That will give you decent reliable connectivity without wires and it doesn\\'t add much more bulk to your bag than the stupid power brick included with this device.Battery operation works. I didn\\'t try to run it dead so I can\\'t speak to the \"500 page\" battery claim. I would expect they base that on \"fast draft black and white\" printing, which would probably give you about 100 normal pages.The ink carts are a bit small and there aren\\'t any \"xl\" carts available, so it won\\'t be a super-cheap way to print on the road.Print quality is average for an ink jet. I would not use them for important customer presentations, but it is fine for interoffice documents (invoices, working on drafts, memos, letters).I\\'m actually going to keep it. I bought it at Best Buy and don\\'t want to deal with their CS nightmare to try to return due to lack of satisfaction. I\\'ll keep it in the car for emergency print needs on the road.I would not recommend it unless you have no other choice. I\\'m not sure there are any better alternatives, and I\\'ve looked for one. HP could make this a lot better by putting the power supply in the body, including a custom bag, and adding wifi/ePrint. This model is basically an antiquated (think 1998) compact inkjet with a battery slapped on the back.', 'I\\'ve used and enjoyed Post-Its for years, but this new product seems completely worthless.  The package contains three \"dispensers\" which are merely folded-up paper sleeves into which you insert an accordion-fold stack of Post-Its.  You then affix the dispenser to your laptop or any other surface and voil&agrave;!  Note paper at your fingertips!Pros:It has Post-Its.Cons:The dispensers are thin and flimsy.There are only 20 Post-Its in a stack.The adhesive may leave marks.When you pull a Post-It, it can wrinkle easily.The dispensers are gray and yucky chartreuse and hot pink. You don\\'t need the dispenser to use the notes.You have to unstick the dispenser from laptop to refill it.I don\\'t see the value of this product and I am amazed that it was created.  Do you really have to stick note papers to your laptop? If so, it would be easier to stick a regular stack of Post-Its or just carry a stack of them in your case or pocket.  Twenty sheets to a pack is too few; you\\'re always refilling the dispenser.  This seems like a needless and overpriced product.', \"Really disappointed at this refill. I mean, I don't think this is the real Parker. The print on the metal surface of the refill is kind of unclear and oily. Seems like a cheap fake one. I tried both the refills in the package, and after a few pages writing, and by page I mean, just small memo pads, it stopped working. There is no sufficient ink coming out, I get very weak blue and white lines on paper, just as if you have already used it up! Both refills in the box works like that. Couldn't believe it. Just throw them away.\", \"I have been using a gel-type wrist rest from another brand that starts with an F. Seeing this 3M foam wrist rest on Amazon Vine, I thought why not give it a try. Well, I can agree that this is a comfortable wrist rest, and I don't even detect any strong smell unless I stick my nose to the wrist rest's surface. However, I find this foam wrist rest to be inferior to my gel wrist rest on one important count: cleanliness. With the gel wrist rest, all I need is to wipe it with a damp cloth, and the non-permeable surface is clean as new. But this form wrist rest has a cloth surface, which is permeable. Yes, it has been treated with an antimicrobial agent and perhaps nothing can grow on it. But it does not follow that we don't have to clean the surface. This wrist rest attracts lint and other small dirt like magnet, and thanks to its black color, the dirt is very visible. Needless to say, I am switching back to my gel wrist rest.\", 'It takes four batteries which is a bit much.  I used the USB in the computer and it sounded powerful but it just chopped up the pencil.  Not smooth.', 'How much can really be said about them.  Avery makes great labeling products.  They even supply templates on their website for free.  They print out perfectly on the sheet of badges every time.  These specific name tags have just the right amount of stickiness to stay on, but can also be used a few times while still maintaining the stick.', 'Avery is a brand I trust  I have tried other but not sure of names they did not stand up to the quality of Avery Labels.  They fit my files great and last for years.  I would recommend to friends.  I have been in my own business for 5 year, But used them in other companies  prior.', \"No amount of pushing or prying with a thin, sturdy object would get the tape compartment open, and I eventually decided it wasn't worth losing a finger jumst to have a two inch piece of tape pop out of the dispenser.  It isn't much smaller than a roll of tape on a plastic dispenser, with the advantage that you can strap it over your fingers, but the disadvantage that you can't size the tape as needed.  Is this really an improvement?  Perhaps it's more environmentally friendly over the long run, but only if it works.Back to the drawing board, Scotch!\", \"The printer is a 5 star unit, but CANON's attitude toward LINUX insofar as driver support is terrible.  The printer has served me well, but the linux issue tends to make me think I might have preferred an EPSON.  I would never own a Hewlett-Packard printer because of terrible warranty support (several hundred in a school district).  So CANON or EPSON are my choices for photographic work.  I prefer CANON inks and they are easier to find than EPSON.\", \"This is a good shredder for the price and is probably better than the similarly priced and equivalent theFellowes Powershred W-11C 11 Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder (3103201)model because it can shred CDs/DVDs, while the Fellowes cannot.However, it's really VERY loud-it will definitely disturb office mates or house mates, even neighbors could hear it if your window is open. It's really as loud as a power tool!It also tends to really bog down when feeding it more than about 6 sheets. It almost feels like it's going to burn out or something.  It cannot really do 12 sheets reliably at all.Also, the top part (the motor) is a bit heavy and cumbersome to have to lift off in order to empty the bin, which you have to do often. This does have a built in handle which is nice but it's still a hassle and you have to then put the motor (which is often quite dusty and littered with paper shreds and could be oily) on the carpet/floor. As someone who appreciates good design, a shredder with a lift-motor atop a bin is not that.I also don't know the long term reliability of this shredder nor how much of a hassle it would be getting warranty service/replacement from Amazon on it should it break down. I assume they would be pretty good about it though.On the plus side, this shredder is just about the perfect size, nice and compact and it does CDs/DVDs and credit/debit cards well.I ended up returning this and getting theFellowes Powershred 100% Jam Proof 79Ci 14 Sheet Cross-Cut Paper Shredder (3227901)instead. Although it was more money, it is tons more graceful in almost every respect, and completely alleviates all the negatives with this Amazon Basics shredder that I experienced.If you want a better shredder overall that is nearly silent, and will be more fun to use and probably last longer, you might take a look at the Fellows 79Ci instead. However if you want a lower-priced shredder and don't mind a few negatives, this AmazonBasics one will probably suit you just fine.\", 'I know, I know - you\\'re thinking \"so what, they\\'re just binder tabs.\"  But when you put together materials in a 3-hole binder, the difference between professional and sloppy, or useful and confusing, is often just that - good dividers and a good index page.These dividers are really nice.  As you can see from the product description and photos, you get 6 sets of 5 divider tabs numbered 1-5 within each set, plus a laser-printer-ready index page.  The index page is color coded to the tabs, and both are in a modern, florescent color that will leave your materials looking jazzy.  The tabs are slick plastic affixed to bond paper, and the whole package is very well put together.  (If you need more tabs than 5 per binder, Avery makes sets ranging from8 tabsper set to32 tabsper set, plus sets with tabs for the 12 months orA-Z)).Given my choice, I might slightly prefer more sedate colors for some of my materials, but these \"contemporary\" fluorescents are eye catching and appealing.  I strongly recommend these if a five tab set meets your needs.', 'This is a cool pen. I did not have it long before it started leaking (mild) it would effect the way the pen would write. I was afraid that it would get worse and end up all over me so I returned it.Really good company, nice pen. I will purchase another one in the future probably will be a little bit more picky though.', \"These are pretty nice, juicy-feeling markers. They bleed a little bit on regular copy paper. I like that there's a good selection of colors.My only complaint is that the marker cap colors are much lighter than the actual marker colors, so be sure to test the color on scrap paper before you dive right in.I would buy these for kids and for general fun coloring, but if you need color accuracy be careful.\", 'I am not a student, but a professional adult with a bad habit.  I tend to write down important pieces of information, like telephone numbers, on any loose piece of paper I can find.  I know others who do it, so maybe you can relate.

The perforated pages allow me to easily remove it and put it in the file it belongs in,  No more frantic search in the piles of paper on my desk!', \"Some of us have products that we've had for years, whether it be a book or album, that we either can't or would prefer not to update to a newer format. For me, I have a few old paperbacks that are no longer in print and several vinyl albums. After a number of years, some of these things can start to come apart. This Scotch book tape addresses that need. I think this is a very good idea for those with large book or record collections and allows preserving the old favorites.\", 'Skip the high yield cartridges.  They leak everywhere.  I am going back to the low yield.  I have had problems with 2 of 4 thus far, and I am only 3 months into the cartridges.', \"I like the concept of a rubber bands in a convenient ball.When I first received them, I was initially pleased.  Purchased in late November, it is now mid February of the following year.As I am getting thru the rubber band ball, I find they snap and break even before surrounding an object.  Considering the price, I cannot justify recommending them.In many cases, they don't seem to stretch much as well.\", \"I like the product.  I like how it stores Post-It notes.  I like the penholder.  I like the promise of being able to mount it and remove it.  Unfortunately the elastic snap-back thing did not work for me at all.  I stretched out the elastic, creating an unsightly situation that I had to remove by force.  In the process I ruined the straps and now I can't mount it again.  I was going to mount it to the fridge and my wife didn't trust the adhesive.  Glad she talked me out of it.Great idea, but execution of the main feature failed.  I'm pretty sure I followed the instructions, but once the thing's mounted for a few weeks those instructions get tossed.  If there is some special procedure for removal they should put them on the unit.\", 'Not fair to the ink that I hated this printer so much, but this expensive set of cartridges dried up just as fast as the cheaper no-names... go figure.  I finally wised up and bought another brand of printer.', 'I\\'ve used print at home business cards before, and they always left a rough edge.  There was no way around it- you could tell you printed them at home.  I have to say however, that these \"Clean Edge\" business cards are a vast improvement on the past!  To a trained eye, you can still see the edge was that of a tear-away, but they look pretty darn good!  I wouldn\\'t be embarrassed to pass these out, as I was with the older versions.', \"I have this printer and I also had the 2140 before it. After about 1000 sheets I get a pop up on my computer telling me the toner is bad. I know, starter cartridge, low yield. The problem is, the print quality is fine so I know there is nothing wrong with the toner.Once this cartridge alerts pops up though it will no longer print at all. You will get nothing out of the printer except the alarm. So if you are in the middle of something, be prepared to drop it.Now, replaced the cartridge. About 1500 pages later the same alarm. Print quality is fine but if this printer decides it is time to spend another 40 bucks on a toner cartridge that is that. You cannot use the printer until you replace the cartridge.As I said earlier I had the Brother 2140 which was the prior non wireless version. I never saw an alarm such as this. You may have gotten a low toner alarm but if the print quality was ok you could ignore it and get another 500-1000 sheets no problems.So it appears Brother 'fixed' the ability to actually ignore the alarm as you could with the 2140 by completely disabling the printer in the 2170w model when it decides it is time to pony up some cash.This will be the last Brother product I purchase.\", \"What can I say, it's Scotch tape.  I could certainly use the 3 rolls of tape as Christmas is quickly approaching.\", 'I have seen these all over the place.  They are pretty basic, but the price and functionality are great.  I have several.', \"If using these Pens to draw the illustrious prince of fire, then they do not hold up as well since Paper Mate changed the old formula. They used to be great art Pens but they are more water-based ink now so it isn't as dark or pronounced.Okay for regular use though, but I don't like them as much now since it looks like a watery ink.\", \"The introduction of Macs into my small law office has not been completely without problems. Our old but fully networkable printers were not Mac compatible. This meant that to get something printed it needed to be saved on the network drive and then printed by my assistant or emailed directly to her.This arrangement worked well for almost a year. Once I switched fromMicrosoft Office 2004 for Mac Standardto Pages which is part of theApple iWork '08I started rethinking printing. Pages templates (standard and customized) quickly create superb documents. It seemed silly to impose another step in the process, particularly for routine correspondence that might not normally be saved on the hard drive.So I began looking for a reliable, inexpensive monochrome laser printer. The one requirement I abandoned was that the printer be either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It simply adds too much to the price for too little gain. A USB connection works fine for the small jobs I produce.I settled on this Brother printer. It is networkable so in the unlikely event my assistant needs another printer, she can print to mine. Even though it has an Ethernet connection, I do not use it as the connectors in my office are fully engaged.The printing product is crisp and clean. A laser letter off my custom templates (a quick and amazing Pages feature) appears totally professional. Given the price of this monochrome machine, I suspect many other small offices will find it as impressive as I do.\", \"Hard to really rate basic copy paper but it came as promised, shipping wasn't as quick as I'd hoped but other than that was great.\", 'These are just good old fashion ball point pens with a good fine point.

I fantasize about running it over with my car - that's how much of a hassle it has been.The Good (and the reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1):1. Color copies are crisp and look good - especially with a higher quality paper.The Bad:1.  The scanner makes me insane.  It is so slow I could send my document more efficiently via pony express.  It also randomly doesn't work some days - particularly after scanning multi-page documents.2.  HP customer 'support' is so bad it's like a comedy routine about outsourced customer support.  If you need help, plan to devote a few hours on the phone to HP 'support', and plan to go through long checklists that are unrelated to your problem.  The last 2 times I called with a question their solution was to unplug the unit and leave it unplugged for a few days and try again.3.  The fax is slow and sometimes unreliable.4.  Like others, I was annoyed that I needed to buy my own USB cable - and the first one I bought didn't work with this printer (though it works with other things) - I had to get another.5.  The set-up.  I may not be a pro but I am hardly a tech novice - I have a home office and have used several different all-in-ones in the past.  This is the first time that installing a printer caused me so much trouble (including buying multiple USB cables and calling HP 'support' twice).Also, and I can't count this as a negative since it is stated, be aware that this unit does not copy wirelessly unless you have an Ethernet connection/card.Bottom line:  Hours upon hours of hassle and frustration make this unit not worth it at any price.\", 'I got sick and tired of trying to find the end piece of our large rolls of Scotch Packing Tape, and thought that these would solve the problem.

I can hear callers but they can't hear me.  Either it is the magic jack or this is not compatible with my magic jack.\", \"When I was in school and using paper on a regular basis, the main problems I experienced were indenting or tearing from pressing too hard with a pencil and having weak paper that couldn't stand up to the pressure, bleed-through (the writing on the front could be seen so clearly that writing on the back was a bad idea), and shredding due to erasing. I tested this paper for those three issues and was surprised that it didn't suffer from any of them. As filler paper goes, it's on the stronger side and was surprisingly opaque from front to back (at least with the use of regular and colored pencils and a ballpoint pen- I can't speak for very wet ink use).The selling point of this is that it has a plastic strip on the side to reinforce the points at which it has been punched for binders and mine seemed solid in this regard. Other reviewers have said that the lamination has come off or bled glue. I'm guessing this problem may relate to the age of the paper and the temperature at which it has been stored in the shops that sell it, but I can only say that my paper did not suffer from any of these issues. I even tried to peel off the lamination by slipping my fingernails under it and trying to pry it off and couldn't do it. It seems, at least at this point in time, to be pretty firmly attached.Another issue mentioned in negative reviews (and I always check those reviews as I'm sure they're true) that I didn't have a problem with is misaligned printing on the sheets. I checked my paper for this as well and all of the sheets seemed identical and the squares were perfectly aligned. It's not impossible that there are runs at the beginning or end of printing the paper that aren't aligned, but, again, I fanned through the pages and mine were perfect.Finally, I checked the price on this paper at other outlets and Amazon's price is actually quite competitive. In fact, it was the cheapest that I could find at $3.49 for 100 sheets. All in all, I think this is pretty good quality paper for a more than reasonable price.\", 'UPDATE:  Days are now colder and I am demanding more of my foot heater.  The Fellowes Heat & Slide Footrest doesn\\'t do an adequate job of keeping my feet warm (I have to slide my foot around the footrest to find the heat).  On the flip side, my favorite foot heater (Vornado, see below), does an excellent job of keeping my feet warm (& I love the fan).  I\\'ve down-rated the Fellowes from 3 stars to 1 star.  Spend your money on the Vornado & you won\\'t be disappointed.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I LOVE a good Foot Heater & have been using theVornado EH1-0039-06 225-Watt SoleAire Foot Rest and Personal Space Heaterfor the past 3 years in my office.  The Vornado has a fan & does a great job of distributing heat. The only drawback of the Vornado is that it has a fixed foot position & if you try to move the footrest, sometimes the rubber feet with come off & you have to bend down to put them back in.This Fellowes Foot Heater does not have a built in fan & warms your feet with a gentle warmth that takes a little time to get warm once you turn it on.  The heat seems to come from the middle (around your foot arch) & mine seems to be warmer on my left foot side.  The foot heater does an OK job but you have to be shoe-free to enjoy the gentle warmth that this machine provides.The Fellowes heater gives the user the ability to adjust their foot position, which is a nice feature.  However, the heater moves fairly easily, so it seems that I am constantly adjusting my foot position & sometimes have to bend down under my desk to adjust it by hand.I have let the \"time\" expire on the foot heater a couple of times.  When that happens, the red button flashes.  The first time this happened, I simply pushed the flashing button & it stopped.  The second time, I had to unplug the unit a couple of times before I could get the button to stop flashing.I will use this Fellowes heater in my home office because it is here.  If I had to choose the Vornado over the Fellowes (price not a factor), I would choose the Vornado without hesitation.', \"This all metal stapler is obviously meant for heavy duty office use. It's not big, but it is extremely heavy. It requires more force to use than the Easy Touch stapler, but can staple through a sheet of 20 copier paper without any issues, especially since you can easily pound on it and it won't even notice.In addition to stapling, it can tack as well as pin. There's a catch at the base, accessed from the bottom - press to release the base for tacking. Don't try to pull it apart like most staplers.What's pinning? That's when you staple, but instead of the legs of the staple bending inwards, it bends outwards. It is useful for temporary binding. It's a lot easier to remove, obviously, since you can just slide the (almost straight) staple out. To pin, you push up on the anvil from the base and rotate it. Very effortless and the (spring loaded) anvil locks securely into position when released.If you want something that stays on a desk and can handle lots of abuse, this one is a good choice. My favorite hand held stapler is a plier type - the Bostitch B8HDP. It's not a desk stapler, but it can punch through more sheets of paper (30 or 45, depending on the staple used) without breaking a sweat.\", \"I initially wrote a 4 star review with just one complaint the printer takes too long to get ready to print a first page.I deleted that review today so I can update my review to reflect the 1 star status this printer deserves.  I bought this printer for the 802.11n wireless, because it also already had the other features I was looking for.HP has does a horrible job with the software drivers for this printer.  It looks nice, has a great feature set, has a great price, but it's a pain in the butt to operate.  Initially it took a long time for the printer to prep itself to get ready to print the first page of a doc or photo, then when it finally printed, it was as fast as I'd expect.  A software update seemed to remedy this, however, that problem and other problems continued, such as the disappearing act the image scanner function seems to do where it will work fine one day, then the next time imaging programs can't find the printer and I have to re-install the printer software.  Sometimes, the printer will take forever to print a color document or photo -- it just crawls along --  and I end up canceling the print job.  The printer can't handle the canceling very well, because it will then print out several mostly blank pages with just a little printing of junk characters till you cancel that a few times and it wastes so much paper.terrible!\", \"The KX-TG7645M does not have speed dial capability!!!

I can check with the power company, talk with neighbors, and potentially most important, if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.
