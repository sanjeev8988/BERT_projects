But it\n","is rare to find people who speak and hear true words  even when they are not\n","pleasing to hear.   —Ramayana1  My love for both physics and philosophy, which\n","started in  childhood, went on to become a lifelong passion, a quest  that\n","continues to this day. As a college undergraduate, I  immersed myself in the\n","nascent field of consciousness studies  and discovered that renowned theoretical\n","physicists, such as  Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger, had been inspired\n","by Vedic insights and used them as the philosophical lens  for understanding\n","quantum mechanics. This approach came  to be accepted as one of the\n","interpretations of quantum  mechanics in the twentieth century and has, since\n","then,  influenced many scientists.   Later, while studying computer science in\n","the US, I   became interested in algorithms. An algorithm is a systematic,\n","step-by-step process to achieve an outcome, like a recipe,  whether for cooking,\n","getting a driver’s license, or managing  payroll. Algorithms are typically used\n","to describe streamlined,  repetitive and predictable procedures.  The interplay\n","between my spiritual quest and interest   in computer science generated many\n","questions that have  intrigued me for the past several decades, such as:\n","1235_ai.txt13 25-11-2020 14:56:43 xiv • Artificial Intelligence and the Future\n","of Power  •  Physics can be viewed as the discovery of nature’s   algorithms.\n","But is nature only algorithmic, or are   there also natural processes that\n","cannot be modeled   as algorithms because they transcend all algorithms—  such\n","as exalted spiritual experiences?   •  What are the limits of algorithms in\n","modeling humans?   In particular, is it possible to model human psychology,\n","emotions, and intuitions as algorithms?  •  If all processes could, in\n","principle, be modeled as   algorithms, what would be the implications for free\n","will and the nature of consciousness?  •  How is rtam (rita), an important term\n","used in the   Rig Veda to refer to the patterns that comprise the   fabric of\n","all existence, related to algorithms? Is rtam   related to algo-rithm?  In the\n","early 1970s, a subject of intense discussion was the  investigation of a\n","category of algorithms under the umbrella  term of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n","That is when I started  out as a graduate student specializing in AI; the aim\n","was  simply to develop algorithms for activities like playing chess.  At the\n","time, the best computer program could only just  beat an average human player.\n","But that was then. It took a  quarter of a century for the major milestone in\n","1997 when  an IBM computer program named Deep Blue defeated Garry  Kasparov, the\n","reigning world chess champion. The rest, as  they say, is history.  My lifelong\n","quest has been to understand the nature of   intelligence, both natural and\n","artificial, and how it plays  out at various levels. To pursue this quest, I set\n","up Infinity  Foundation in 1994, a nonprofit organization to promote  dialogue\n","between Eastern and Western schools of thought. Its  first projects included\n","investigations in consciousness studies.  1235_ai.txt14 25-11-2020 14:56:43\n","Introduction • xv  DISRUPTIONS AND BATTLEGROUNDS  Fast forward a quarter\n","century. I have recently reconnected  with AI, a field of research that has been\n","reborn as a new  force. Artificial Intelligence is amplifying human ingenuity\n","and  is the engine driving the latest technological disruption silently  shaking\n","the foundations of society. My use of the term is not  limited narrowly to what\n","AI is specifically in the technical sense,  but also includes the entire\n","ecosystem of technologies that AI  propels forward as their force multiplier.\n","This cluster includes  quantum computing, semiconductors, nanotechnology,\n","medical  technology, brain-machine interface, robotics, aerospace, 5G,  and much\n","more. I use AI as the umbrella term because it  leverages their development and\n","synergizes them.  On the one hand, AI is the holy grail of technology;   the\n","advancement that people hope will solve problems  across virtually every domain\n","of our lives. On the other, it  is disrupting a number of delicate equilibriums\n","and creating  conflicts on a variety of fronts.   Given the vast canvas on which\n","AI’s impact is being felt,   one needs a simple lens to discuss its complex\n","ramifications  in a meaningful and accessible way. After several rounds of\n","restructuring the book, I zeroed in on using the following key  battles of AI as\n","the organizing principle. Artificial Intelligence  plays a pivotal role in each\n","of these disruptions, and each  of these battlegrounds has multiple players with\n","competing  interests and high stakes:  1. Battle for economic development and\n","jobs  2. Battle for power in the new world order  3. Battle for psychological\n","control of desires and agency  4. Battle for the metaphysics of the self and its\n","ethics  5. Battle for India’s future  1235_ai.txt15 25-11-2020 14:56:43 xvi •\n","Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power  These battles already exist but\n","AI is exacerbating them and  changing the game. In each case, the prevailing\n","equilibriums  are disintegrating, and as a result, creating tensions among  the\n","parties held in balance. We are entering an epoch of  disequilibrium in which a\n","period of chaos is inevitable.  Eventually, however, a new equilibrium will be\n","established,  and a new kind of world will emerge.  What follows is how AI is\n","shaping these battles.  Battleground 1: Economic Development and Jobs  A\n","recurrent debate surrounding AI concerns the extent of  human work that could be\n","replaced by machines over the  next twenty years when compared to new jobs\n","created by  AI. Numerous reports have addressed this issue, reaching a  wide\n","range of conclusions. Experts consider it a reasonable  consensus that\n","eventually a significant portion of blue- and  white-collar jobs in most\n","industries will become obsolete, or  at least transformed, to such an extent\n","that workers will need  re-education to remain viable. This percentage of\n","vulnerable  jobs will continue to increase over time. The obsolescence  will be\n","far worse in developing countries where the standard  of education is lower.\n","Forecasts, however, disagree on the  precise timing of this disruption and on\n","the types of human  work that might remain safe from machines in the long run.\n","The routine assurance given to these reasonable concerns   is that when AI\n","eliminates certain jobs, those employees  forced out will move up the value\n","chain to higher-value tasks.  This simplistic and misleading answer overlooks\n","the fact that  the training and education required to advance people is not\n","happening nearly at the same feverish rate as the adoption  of AI. Those that\n","promise the solution of re-education have  not thus far put their money where\n","their mouth is. The gap  of employee qualifications will inevitably widen.\n","1235_ai.txt16 25-11-2020 14:56:43 Introduction • xvii  Business owners and labor\n","have always had certain   competing interests, with the former looking to\n","optimize  profits and the latter concerned about wages and employment.\n","Artificial Intelligence disrupts this precarious balance because  it suddenly\n","kills old jobs; it also creates new jobs, but the  most lucrative new ones will\n","be concentrated in communities  with high levels of education and availability\n","of capital.  More broadly, AI will worsen the divide between the rich  and poor,\n","the haves and the have-nots. This will intensify the  schism between the camps\n","having divergent vested interests.  There is a real possibility that AI may\n","trigger an   unprecedented level of unemployment and precipitate social\n","instability. Especially for countries like India, where a large  percentage of\n","the population lacks the education that is  vital to survive a technological\n","tsunami; the adverse effects  could be shattering.  My approach to AI’s social\n","impact is neither haloed   by utopian fantasy nor dipped in gloom. Chapter 2,\n","The  Battle for Jobs, discusses the potential for unemployment  and economic\n","upheaval from the widespread adoption of  AI. It raises practical concerns: What\n","will happen when AI  makes large numbers of workers obsolete? Who will pay  for\n","the re-education of the literally millions of displaced  workers? Will the new\n","jobs be in places far removed from  where the unemployment will hit hard? Will\n","society’s wealth  become even more concentrated in the hands of a few than  it\n","already is because a minuscule percentage of humans will  control the powerful\n","AI technologies? How will the new  haves and have-nots fight for resources, and\n","how might  such social disequilibrium ultimately play out?  This battleground is\n","important for industrialists and labor   activists, as well as for economists\n","and policymakers. Civic  leaders, politicians, public intellectuals and media\n","cannot   1235_ai.txt17 25-11-2020 14:56:43 xviii • Artificial Intelligence and\n","the Future of Power  continue to ignore the evolution of AI. More voices must\n","enter the debates to propose appropriate, coherent responses  and policy\n","changes.  Battleground 2: Global Power  China is using AI as its strategic\n","weapon to leapfrog ahead of  the United States and achieve global domination.\n","Chapter 3,  The Battle for World Domination, explains the battleground  where\n","the geopolitical competition between China and the US  is playing out. Both\n","these superpowers recognize AI as the  most prized summit to conquer in their\n","race for leadership  in economic, political and military affairs.  While\n","aerospace, semiconductors, biotech, and other   technologies are also crucial in\n","this race, AI is the force  multiplier that brings them together and catapults\n","them to  new levels. Both these countries are heavily invested in AI,  and\n","between them they control the vast majority of AI  related intellectual\n","property, investments, market share and  key resources.  Besides competing\n","directly against each other, the US and   China will also compete for control\n","over satellite nations and  new colonies. This results from the fact that the\n","disruptive  technology will weaken many sovereign states and destabilize\n","fragile political equilibriums. There is a realistic scenario for  the re-\n","colonization of the world differently, i.e. as digital  colonies.  Furthermore,\n","some private companies controlling this   technology could become more powerful\n","than many countries,  just as the British East India Company—a private joint-\n","stock  company—became more powerful than any country of its  time. This\n","battleground is relevant to readers interested in  geopolitics and the emerging\n","world order.  1235_ai.txt18 25-11-2020 14:56:43 Introduction • xix  Battleground\n","3: Psychological Control and Agency  A troubling trend is that as machines get\n","smarter, a growing  number of humans are becoming dumber. In a sense, the\n","public has outsourced its critical thinking, memory and  agency to increasingly\n","sophisticated digital networks. As  in any outsourcing arrangement, the provider\n","of services  becomes more knowledgeable about the client’s internal  affairs and\n","the client becomes more dependent on the  supplier. The quest for deep knowledge\n","and critical thinking  is becoming a thing of the past because it is easier for\n","people  to use internet searches whenever any information is needed.  People are\n","operating on autopilot rather than thinking and  learning on their own.   Google\n","is becoming the devata, or deity, that will instantly   supply all knowledge.\n","Mastering the rituals and tricks of  interacting with this digital deity is\n","considered a mark of  achievement to be proudly flaunted among peers. Education\n","is  seen merely as a prerequisite for getting a job. Deep learning  in machines\n","is resulting in shallow knowledge in humans—an  irony indeed. Cognitive skills\n","like memory and attention span  are atrophying, even as knowledge, authority and\n","agency are  being transferred from humans to machines. In effect, AI has\n","managed to hack human psychology.  In an era of instant access, social media has\n","confused   people between knowledge, opinion and popularity; whatever  is\n","popular is assumed to be true. Individuals who lack  followers, likes, shares\n","and comments on social media often  retreat into low self-esteem, depression,\n","substance abuse, or  even suicide.  Machines surreptitiously model individual\n","psychological   behavior by identifying the patterns of users’ choices, and\n","then use these models to manipulate and control their actions.   1235_ai.txt19\n","25-11-2020 14:56:43 xx • Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power  The\n","paradox is that the manipulation is done under the guise  of free services that\n","are difficult to resist because they have  now become an all-too normal part of\n","our lives. Those who  control the psychological models can use AI to influence\n","human emotions and behavior. What concerns me is the  psychological, emotional\n","and mental hijacking in progress  through these technologies.  Some readers will\n","have a mental block that prevents   them from accepting the viability of such\n","psychological  interventions. They need reminding that the Russians hacked  the\n","2016 US presidential election with the use of Facebook  and the British firm,\n","Cambridge Analytica. Chapter 4, The  Battle for Agency, explains how AI is\n","taking advantage of  emotional vulnerabilities and hijacking the agency of large\n","numbers of people worldwide.  There is a vibrant branch of AI that continually\n","refines   the construction of individual psychological profiles. The  technology\n","has two parts: building individuals’ emotional  maps, and using those maps to\n","intervene and produce targeted  feelings and outcomes. Most people are\n","uncomfortable  accepting that machines can uncover their private selves  to the\n","extent of knowing them better than a spouse or  close friend. The truth is, in\n","some ways, machines know  individuals even better than they know themselves,\n","because  people know only their conscious selves and cannot access  their\n","unconscious levels, and also because machines are  capable of detailed and\n","extremely long term memory that  exceeds human capacity. Machines penetrate us\n","far more  deeply and analyze our personal behavior microscopically  and\n","intimately. They record how we unconsciously respond  to online choices and use\n","this to develop insights into aspects  of ourselves that we might not want to\n","publicly disclose or  even privately come to terms with.   1235_ai.txt20\n","25-11-2020 14:56:43 Introduction • xxi  Machine learning is the field that\n","trains computers   through analysis of large quantities of data. This data can\n","be acquired by seducing the public to part with it voluntarily;  people are\n","tantalized with online carrots and their responses  are monitored, tracked and\n","recorded. Using emotional  hooks as a bribe, machines tease out users’\n","motivations,  both conscious and unconscious. An entire industry of AI  based\n","artificial pleasures is emerging. Recently, litigation has  started against the\n","large digital platforms for surreptitiously  gathering private data on\n","citizens.2  The raw material required to develop machine   understanding of\n","human desires and the artificial manipulation  of them is called big data. Most\n","people happily and  voluntarily give up this private data, often without\n","realizing it. Once the digital systems capture this data, they   amass\n","unprecedented power and wealth by analyzing and  manipulating our subconscious\n","thoughts. Shoshana Zuboff,  a social psychologist, and author of The Age of\n","Surveillance  Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New  Frontier of\n","Power, characterizes the transfer of data from  the public to the digital giants\n","as an act of theft.  During the last two decades, the leading surveillance\n","capitalists—Google, later followed by Facebook,   Amazon and Microsoft—helped to\n","drive this societal   transformation while simultaneously ensuring their\n","ascendance to the pinnacle of the epistemic hierarchy.   They operated in the\n","shadows to amass huge knowledge   monopolies by taking without asking, a\n","maneuver that   every child recognizes as theft.

The\n","digital capitalists constantly  reassure the public that data collection is for\n","their own  good using several pretexts. For instance, we are told that\n","surveillance is a public safety service. The cameras capturing  data everywhere\n","are keeping us safe. Airlines claim that the  use of facial recognition speeds\n","up the boarding process  and makes travel safer.4 Medical information being\n","captured  helps develop custom diets and generates the appropriate  grocery list\n","for one’s family. Cookies are installed on  users’ devices under the pretext\n","that this provides more  personalized experiences.  Many companies use AI to spy\n","on us and collect our   private information, justifying their behavior under the\n","garb  of serving the public. In a recent article, Zuboff exposes this  hoax of\n","free services in her powerful voice:  We celebrated the new digital services as\n","free, but now   we see that the surveillance capitalists behind those   services\n","regard us as the free commodity. We thought   that we search Google, but now we\n","understand that   Google searches us. We assumed that we use social   media to\n","connect, but we learned that connection is how   social media uses us. …We’ve\n","begun to understand that   “privacy” policies are actually surveillance\n","policies.…  The Financial Times reported that a Microsoft   facial recognition\n","training database of 10 million images   plucked from the internet without\n","anyone’s knowledge   and supposedly limited to academic research was   employed\n","by companies like IBM and state agencies   that included the United States and\n","Chinese military.…  1235_ai.txt22 25-11-2020 14:56:43 Introduction • xxiii\n","….Privacy is not private, because the effectiveness   of these and other private\n","or public surveillance and   control systems depends upon the pieces of\n","ourselves   that we give up—or that are secretly stolen from us.5  The private\n","flow of data from consumer to machine also  promotes the transfer of human\n","agency from humans to  machines. The data that surveillance companies capture is\n","their source of power and is the fuel for the new economy  of trillions of\n","dollars. Zuboff has called this a “bloodless  coup from above” and warns of a\n","growing gap between  “what we know and what is known about us”.6  By figuring\n","out the cognitive comfort zones for individuals,   AI-driven systems can deliver\n","emotional and psychological  needs, thus gradually making people dependent on\n","them. As  machine intelligence increases people move toward living in  a world\n","of artificially induced emotions and gratification.  Eventually this trend leads\n","to a syndrome I call moronization  of the masses. This mode of existence feeds\n","into the business  models of digital capitalism, as shown in Figure 1.  Those\n","who know—or should know—about the wider   consequences of this transfer of\n","agency have been largely  silent. There has been insufficient open debate in\n","which the  utopian view of AI could be counterbalanced by realistic  concern.\n","Though think tanks and industry consortia such as  Open AI, Deep Mind Ethics and\n","Society, and Partnership on  AI do address concerns about AI, they tend to be\n","founded  or dominated by the big tech players and aligned with those  companies’\n","commercial interests. While I am enthusiastic  about AI’s potential, what\n","gravely concerns me is the lack  of open, thoughtful public debate on what an\n","AI-dominated  future could look like.   1235_ai.txt23 25-11-2020 14:56:43 xxiv •\n","Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power   Figure 1: Moronization of the\n","Masses  Artificial Intelligence technologies must be publicly debated  as\n","disruptors of the social structures that shape the world  order—testing and\n","redefining the limits of liberty, the future  of democracy, and the meaning of\n","social justice.

However, beneath\n","the surface   1235_ai.txt24 25-11-2020 14:56:44 Introduction • xxv  the\n","suppliers and consumers have opposing interests—in  privacy, data rights,\n","agency, intellectual property rights and  free speech.   This battle is distinct\n","from the other battles in one   important respect, i.e., one player is largely\n","ignorant that  such a battle is under way. The suppliers of digital services\n","understand the game and play it skillfully, while most  consumers are not even\n","aware that the interests of producers  and consumers of digital media are at\n","odds. In fact, when  people are informed that they are voluntarily surrendering\n","psychological control of their lives, they usually dismiss it  as a conspiracy\n","theory.   Fortunately, many consumer activists, social scientists   and legal\n","experts are already raising alarms about the conflict,  and they will find this\n","battle particularly significant. For  instance, Pratyusha Kalluri, an AI\n","researcher at Stanford,  has written a short but powerful piece in Nature.   It\n","is not uncommon now for AI experts to ask whether   an AI is ‘fair’ and ‘for\n","good’. …The question to pose   is a deeper one: how is AI shifting power?  Law\n","enforcement, marketers, hospitals and other   bodies apply artificial\n","intelligence to decide on matters   such as who is profiled as a criminal, who\n","is likely   to buy what product at what price, who gets medical   treatment and\n","who gets hired. These entities increasingly   monitor and predict our behavior,\n","often motivated by   power and profits.8  Chapter 4 explains the most difficult\n","message of the book,  because many people simply do not want to believe how\n","remarkably successful AI has become at hacking our minds,  psychology and\n","emotions.

Battleground 4: Metaphysics\n","The success of AI is based on training machines to achieve  intelligent\n","behavior. This has empowered a worldview  according to which life, mind and\n","consciousness are merely  biological processes running on human beings as\n","machines.  In effect, AI has helped biological materialism sneak in  through the\n","back door while the leaders of the consciousness  movement have been blissfully\n","taken off guard.  I come from the diametrically opposite side in this   battle:\n","I have been deeply invested in philosophies based  on the primacy of\n","consciousness. And lately I have become  concerned that this worldview is being\n","undermined by the  powerful trajectory of the AI revolution. Figure 2\n","illustrates  my intellectual journey centered on physics and Vedanta as  shown\n","at the top, and my algorithm-based career shown at  the bottom.

What\n","troubles me is that the digital industry empowering   self-learning systems is\n","proceeding in a direction opposite  to that of consciousness movements. In fact,\n","this is the  real clash of civilizations under way: the battle between\n","algorithm and being.  Chapter 5, The Battle for Self, explains how the technical\n","and commercial success of AI is built on the assumption  that biology and mind\n","are algorithmic machines that can  be modeled, mimicked and manipulated using\n","artificial  interventions.

Though\n","conventionally this framework is  applied to individual persons, I am extending\n","it and applying  it to nations.  A nation’s sthula/physical body consists of its\n","geography,   infrastructure, resources and other tangible assets. There is a\n","further distinction between internal affairs dealing with the  domestic economy\n","and employment, and foreign affairs to  safeguard its interests internationally.\n","Both of them concern  the physical wellbeing.  The sukshma/mental body of a\n","nation is the state of its   people’s mind and psychology. It is publicly or\n","externally  expressed as their identity, confidence and pride.

Battleground 5:\n","India’s Future  India is an important case study on the impact of AI because\n","that is where all the other four battles come together into  one large and\n","complex battleground.   As a preface to my discussion on India, I point out that\n","Indian society has forsaken its metaphysical roots in dharma 1235_ai.txt28\n","25-11-2020 14:56:44  Introduction • xxix  to chase the Americanization of artha\n","(material pursuits)  and kama (gratification of sensual desires). As a result,\n","it is  neither here nor there—having lost its traditional strengths  both\n","individual and collective, it is at best a poor imitation  of the American\n","dream.  Overpopulation, unemployment and poor education   make India especially\n","vulnerable. Many of its industries  are technologically obsolete and dependent\n","on imported  technologies. India presently has a disappointing level of  AI\n","development and it needs to embark on a rapid program  to catch up.  Meanwhile,\n","the public as well as the leaders are   mesmerized by the foreign social media,\n","seeing it as the  prestigious platform on which to prove oneself. I will explain\n","that this is like welcoming back the East India Company  with hugs and\n","gratitude.  Indians love discussing India as a superpower—either   already or\n","soon to become one. Part Two: Battleground  India offers a sobering picture of\n","the country’s prospects. It  explains that not only is India lagging behind\n","China in AI  by at least a decade, it also routinely gives away its unique  data\n","assets to foreign countries because of the ignorance of its  leaders. Part Two\n","presents the thought experiment according  to which, if the present trajectory\n","continues, India could be  heading toward re-colonization, this time as a\n","digital colony  under the domination of the US and/or China.   India is home to\n","one of the largest talent pools of young   brains, yet the shortsighted policies\n","of its leaders continue  to sell them out as cheap labor to make quick profits\n","from wage arbitrage. In this way, India has squandered  its software lead. This\n","complex battleground is important  to those for whom Indian issues and trends\n","are of special  interest.  1235_ai.txt29 25-11-2020 14:56:44  xxx • Artificial\n","Intelligence and the Future of Power  Just as this manuscript was about to be\n","sent for   publishing, there was a positive development in India. I  am glad to\n","know that Kris Gopalakrishnan, a cofounder of  Infosys and major venture\n","capitalist in India, is leading the  development of policies on data rights.\n","India’s approach to  regulating non-personal data is commendable and a great\n","beginning. Gopalakrishnan is one of the few brilliant thinkers  on this issue in\n","India, and his involvement makes this a  credible initiative. It is too early to\n","evaluate this development;  hopefully, it will begin a new phase in India’s\n","relationship  with AI.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK  My investigations into these\n","disruptions have not been easy  on a personal level in two ways. First, my\n","svadharma (core  purpose) since childhood has been based on the principle of\n","the primacy of consciousness. This worldview is now being  challenged by the\n","opposite model of biological materialism,  and AI is dramatically empowering\n","this materialistic  philosophy.   Second, as a patriotic Indian I have been\n","doing   purva-paksha (critical analysis) of forces that threaten its\n","civilization. The stress test of India discussed in Chapter 6  suggests a\n","diagnosis that many of my fellow Indians will  object to. Some of the hard\n","realities I unmask will shock  readers and expose truths they would rather not\n","hear. But  as I have matured in my journey, it is time to reflect on my\n","insights and crystallize some advice out of deep affection  for the youth who\n","will be custodians of the culture I was  fortunate to be born in.   Supporters\n","suggested that I should perhaps not write   such a critical analysis. But facing\n","a problem head-on is a  1235_ai.txt30 25-11-2020 14:56:44  Introduction • xxxi\n","crucial step toward resolving it. Determined to communicate  this message in\n","good faith and with the best of intentions, I  have looked for role models in\n","the Vedic tradition, exemplars  who faced similar dilemmas and risked their\n","popularity for  the sake of presenting objective and logical arguments. I  found\n","Vidura in the Mahabharata a good role model in  writing this book. He is\n","considered a paragon of truth,  integrity, and impartial and consistent\n","judgment. People find  in him the conscience of the Mahabharata; the principles\n","he advocates have been compiled under the name Vidura niti. His intellectual\n","posture and tone have emboldened  me in writing this book.9 A sequel to this\n","book which is  underway will offer concrete solutions to the predicaments  being\n","exposed here.  We live in an epoch defined by major disruptions, both\n","predictable and unpredictable, desirable and undesirable.  Clearly, AI is a\n","major disruptive influence, one that to date  has not been properly understood,\n","or even discussed, outside  the circles of its experts. A great deal has been\n","written on  AI’s gifts to the world, but not enough on its risks. My goals  are\n","to balance the discourse and empower the advocates that  speak for the underdogs\n","in these conflicts. The emphasis  of this book is to examine society’s\n","vulnerabilities to the  impending technological tsunami. I hope it will shake up\n","the thought leaders that need to be better informed and  more engaged.\n","Artificial Intelligence has spread throughout much of   society, especially\n","since the beginning of the twenty-first  century—across health, military,\n","entertainment, education,  marketing, manufacturing, and just about every other\n","sector.  Even the least technologically savvy among us interacts  with AI on a\n","daily basis when we use social media via a  smartphone or rely on a car’s\n","navigation device. Whether   1235_ai.txt31 25-11-2020 14:56:44 xxxii •\n","Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power  you are a social media fanatic\n","and diehard AI aficionado,  a paranoid skeptic that barely has a social media\n","footprint,  or something in between, it is impossible to escape the  ubiquitous\n","impact of AI technology.  But what if AI is like an iceberg with most of it\n","hidden   beneath the surface? And modern civilization, like the luxury\n","passenger ship, Titanic, is on a collision course with it?  Social and cultural\n","thought leaders continue to embrace AI  as a gateway to a technologically\n","advanced utopia. They are  equivalent to the band that continued playing on the\n","deck  of the ship even as it was sinking. This complicity must be  challenged to\n","give the general population a glimpse into  AI as a potential threat to our\n","society’s rickety foundation.  Currently, people’s reaction to AI is one of two\n","extremes.   Some optimistically imbue AI with an aura of seduction and  magic.\n","Others view it ominously, akin to the smarter-than human robotic villains that\n","take over the world in science  fiction stories and films. Both these extremes\n","overlook the  practical realities of AI that we must confront.   We need\n","institutions and regulations that guard   against economic monopoly and\n","environmental ruin; and  conversation and debates are a critical first step in\n","the  process. The public must be made aware of—and help  monitor—the unfair\n","advantage companies have that can  affect our liberties, our democratic\n","processes, and our very  concept of society.   Today, the charge into the future\n","with AI technology is   being led by American companies such as Google, Amazon,\n","Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Netflix, as well as  Chinese digital\n","behemoths such as Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu  and Huawei. To preempt public\n","activism, technology leaders  promote self-regulation, which unfortunately\n","misses the  point. Their seemingly benevolent stand furthers their own\n","1235_ai.txt32 25-11-2020 14:56:44 Introduction • xxxiii  interests while\n","creating a fog against public investigation.  The problem is the lack of\n","intellectual engagement from  competent groups that do not have a vested\n","interest in the  digital industry.10  Policymakers and other leaders in industry\n","and public   life, however, need to stop reacting as followers and start  to\n","engage the industry more assertively and aggressively.  The irony is that in\n","most democratic countries, the public  does not see itself as digitally\n","colonized. The real challenge,  therefore, is to convince people they are being\n","lulled into  complacency, and that they are explicitly giving up their  agency\n","because of the seductive power of social media.  This book aims to stimulate\n","alternative thinking and   dialogue that may avert the potentially harmful\n","outcomes  of AI. Just as a cardiac stress test is not intended to kill\n","patients, but rather to reveal vulnerabilities and prevent  future catastrophe,\n","I want to stress test present society’s  ability to accommodate AI socially,\n","economically and  politically. India functions as an especially important case\n","study on the likely disruptions of AI.  This book invites nonexperts into the\n","conversation   around AI. This is important because, unlike other technical\n","fields such as nuclear energy and genetic engineering where  the public actively\n","debates the social implications, in the case  of AI the public has not yet\n","become energized.  Just as I had finished writing this book, the world was\n","suddenly disrupted by Covid-19. The pandemic has created  a cascading effect\n","that is reverberating through every aspect  of our lives. History books will\n","define this hinge point as a  discontinuity separating life before and after.\n","This called for  a re-examination of this book and I started asking myself:\n","Does the pandemic effectively stop, or slow down, AI? If  so, the book is\n","already obsolete because the impact of AI   1235_ai.txt33 25-11-2020 14:56:44\n","xxxiv • Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power  would be overshadowed\n","by the crisis. Or is it the other way  around, namely, that its effect will\n","solidify AI and accelerate  its advancement?   I concluded it was the latter:\n","The defeat of Covid-19 will   be claimed as a victory for AI and the scientific\n","materialism  on which it is based, and this will produce a great leap  forward\n","in the march of AI. Though the Covid-19 pandemic  has thrown economic forecasts\n","into disarray, and many of  the statistics cited in this book will need to be\n","revised, the  overall trend I explain is not likely to change. In fact, my\n","prediction is that due to Covid-19, the effects of AI will  accelerate even\n","faster than before.   However, this crisis will also trigger greater ethical\n","introspection. There will be a new level of concern for  humankind’s harmful\n","exploitation of nature, including  animals, by turning them into “property” like\n","any other  economic asset. The interconnectivity of all things, as  captured in\n","the Vedic principle of Indra’s Net, deserves special  attention. The pandemic is\n","a reminder of materialism going  too far and ending up disrupting its own\n","equilibrium.   My goal is to educate and empower users and consumers   of AI, as\n","well as civic leaders, so they will be better equipped  to engage the digital\n","giants on a level playing field. We are  not yet powerless in this battle but\n","must play our cards  strategically. I hope the information in these pages will\n","inform, enlighten and provoke readers. As citizens we do  have a say in how\n","fast, and in what ways, we allow AI  into our livesand becoming informed is the\n","first step toward  productive interventions.  1235_ai.txt34 25-11-2020 14:56:44\n","PART ONE  ALGORITHM VS BEING  1235_ai.txt1 25-11-2020 14:56:44 1235_ai.txt2\n","25-11-2020 14:56:44 1  OVERVIEW OF AI TECHNOLOGIES  Artificial Intelligence is\n","the future, not only for Russia, but   for all humankind.

Machine\n","learning is   the use of diverse experiences to train the algorithms and   build\n","models that perform actions considered intelligent.   Big data refers to the\n","massive data sets—enormous   collections of examples—that are used to train\n","machines.  🢦 Devices classified as smart homes, wearables and implants  are\n","fundamentally changing not only how humans   interact with machines, but\n","ultimately influence the way   humans think, feel and behave. Virtual Reality\n","(VR)- and   Augmented Reality (AR)-based products are also among   the latest\n","expressions of AI.  🢦 The limits of AI are the subject of much debate and\n","controversy. Most people believe that jobs involving   emotions are inherently\n","beyond the purview of machines.   1235_ai.txt3 25-11-2020 14:56:45 4 •\n","Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power  Confusion between consciousness\n","and intelligence often   clouds these discussions.  🢦 As machine learning\n","continues to advance and expand  the boundaries of AI, its algorithms become\n","better at   emulating human emotions and intuition. Models are   continuously\n","learning and adapting, resulting in machines   that eerily mimic human thought\n","as well as creative   and emotional responses. The gap between human and\n","machine intelligence is shrinking and intelligent machines   often exceed human\n","characteristics—in speed, accuracy,   durability, cost efficiency and endurance.\n","🢦 Artificial Intelligence holds many promises for  improving and enhancing human\n","functioning in a   wide range of applications such as medical diagnostics   and\n","treatment, agricultural science and production,   education, transportation\n","safety and efficiency, military   weapons systems and strategy, financial\n","investment and   management, legal and judicial processes, and recreational\n","and creative activities.  🢦 Unemployment on an unprecedented scale is likely to\n","result from the ever-increasing automation of more   types of jobs. Over time,\n","positions generally considered   safe from AI will be impacted as algorithms\n","become   increasingly sophisticated.  🢦 Current political systems are not\n","prepared to deal  with the radical changes that AI will engender. Social\n","disenfranchisement, population changes, political   upheaval, shifting\n","perceptions of societal norms, and   worsening class distinctions will create\n","widespread unrest.  🢦 As computers exert more control over individual lives,\n","people give up their agency by allowing, encouraging and   even preferring AI to\n","make decisions for them.  1235_ai.txt4 25-11-2020 14:56:45 Overview of AI\n","Technologies • 5  🢦 Of primary concern is the apathy of governments and\n","intellectual elites to address, or even recognize, the   potential severity of\n","AI disruptions.

This is\n","called  ambient AI and it is becoming seamlessly integrated into  the fabric of\n","our lives. Our comfort level with machines  in intimate settings is growing and\n","people are increasingly  speaking to their devices. According to researchers,\n","the use  of voice interface devices for online searches, shopping and  other\n","common tasks is on the rise. By 2022, over half of  all US households will own a\n","smart voice device and use it  for shopping, with Amazon and Google being the\n","dominant  suppliers. Research has revealed that a majority of users  keep smart\n","voice devices in their living rooms because they  feel comfortable with them, as\n","if the device were an actual  person and trusted friend.12  Even before AI’s\n","recent rise, computers had already   taken over many repetitive tasks that can\n","be described with  algorithms.

Furthermore,\n","some tasks require  more data than the human mind can deal with and require\n","faster speeds than any human could match. For example,  automated recognition of\n","speech, handwriting and facial  recognition already surpasses human skill. Nor\n","is AI limited  to merely replicating what humans do. It exceeds human  cognitive\n","abilities in a growing number of applications. An  important research frontier\n","giving AI considerable power  is the range of emotional, aesthetic and\n","psychological  applications discussed in Chapter 4.13  Machine Learning\n","Artificial Intelligence is an umbrella term encompassing a  range of theories\n","and technologies that have existed since  the mid-twentieth century, undergoing\n","numerous cycles of  growth and decline. The emergence of the internet fueled\n","the collection of large quantities of data and breathed new  life into the\n","field. The conditions for the maturation of AI  technology became available at\n","the dawn of the twenty  first century with the evolution of smaller, faster\n","computer  processors and a renewed interest in machine learning, a  foundational\n","concept central to modern AI.14  There are two aspects to the way we learn: the\n","first   being teacher-driven where a pedagogy or structure drives  the process,\n","and the second being student-driven where  the receiver of knowledge draws from\n","multiple sources.  The former is typically bounded by the limitations of the\n","teacher’s own knowledge and methods. The latter allows  the student to\n","assimilate far more knowledge from diverse  sources, both organized and\n","unorganized, and develop  original frameworks to become more knowledgeable than\n","1235_ai.txt6 25-11-2020 14:56:45 Overview of AI Technologies • 7  the teacher.\n","Both these approaches, one supervised by a  teacher or expert and the other\n","unsupervised and self directed, have their parallels in AI.  As an example of\n","the second approach, when you teach   children how to distinguish a dog from a\n","cat, you do not  provide a formal set of rules—an algorithm—to follow.  Instead,\n","you offer examples through which children can  learn. You present an image of a\n","cat next to that of a dog and  point out the differences. The more examples you\n","provide,  the more accurately a child can differentiate. Similarly,  children\n","learn languages by exposure to examples of usage  rather than being taught\n","formal grammar. Children have a  biological learning system that analyzes\n","patterns based on  experiences; this mechanism develops rules to interpret the\n","experiences and these rules improve with each experience.  The idea behind\n","machine learning is to train computers to   perform intelligent functions\n","through experience rather than  relying on a formal set of instructions. This\n","can lead to the  discovery of new patterns and relationships. Unfortunately,\n","the concept is often murky for those outside the field  because many books and\n","articles about it are jargon-heavy  or conceptually dense, and some are works of\n","fantasy about  a futuristic world, utopian or dystopian.15  Machine learning\n","does not rely on predefined rules but   instead uses adaptive learning by trial\n","and error. With each  exposure to new data, the algorithm learns to recognize\n","patterns better. As large quantities of examples are fed into  the system, the\n","machine learns to identify deeply buried  patterns and correlations that it then\n","codifies into rules.  Figure 3 shows one method of machine learning by   trial\n","and error, evaluating each outcome in a feedback loop.  Positive feedback loops\n","reinforce certain behaviors, while  negative feedback loops teach avoidance of\n","certain choices.   1235_ai.txt7 25-11-2020 14:56:45 8 • Artificial Intelligence\n","and the Future of Power  The more experiential data a system uses to learn from,\n","the  smarter it can become.    Figure 3: Simple Machine Learing  Data from past\n","events is used to train algorithms and create  models that are then used to\n","predict the outcome of future  events. The learning is iterative, and the system\n","constantly  becomes smarter with experience.16  Systems of Intelligence   Both\n","natural systems and human-made systems have  intelligence, but of different\n","kinds. I use the term natural  causation to refer to the rules by which natural\n","systems  function, and the natural sciences are the discipline by   1235_ai.txt8\n","25-11-2020 14:56:45  Overview of AI Technologies • 9  which we try to understand\n","this causation. Scientists perform  experiments and gather data to reveal\n","behavioral patterns  and create a model called a hypothesis—their best guess of\n","how the system functions. Further testing either validates  or negates the\n","hypothesis, leading to revisions, retesting,  and a stronger alternative. The\n","process continues, and if no  test negates the model, scientists might\n","eventually reach a  consensus that it can be considered a law. A law is merely\n","a hypothesis explaining how something functions that  scientists have not been\n","able to disprove. In other words,  science is our way of learning the\n","cause–effect rules by  which nature functions.   In the case of natural systems,\n","there is no authority   available to teach us the rules of causation. God does\n","not  provide a user manual or a customer support department.  The term human\n","causation applies to processes that   humans build. The creators of such a\n","system can provide  an instruction manual to explain how it works, so we can\n","automate it using algorithms.  In the case of some human-made systems like\n","ancient   archeological sites or old scripts, the creators of those things  are\n","not available to explain their intentions. No design  specification or training\n","manual exists. Such human systems  are like natural systems in that no authority\n","is available to  teach us the rules; we must independently investigate the\n","system’s behavior patterns to infer how it works. Without  a teacher or defined\n","rules, programmers cannot develop  conventional software to instruct the\n","computer. This is  where machine learning can eliminate the need for an  outside\n","instructive authority because it figures things out  by examining examples.  If\n","a machine can learn on its own to use and imitate   something made by humans, it\n","should not be surprising that it  1235_ai.txt9 25-11-2020 14:56:45  10 •\n","Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power  can also learn to outsmart the\n","human creators. The common  statement that “Computers cannot perform better than\n","their  human creators” is false. Many AI systems beat human  players in games\n","even though the games were constructed  by humans.  An interesting and important\n","kind of intelligence is   unconscious human intelligence, which is behavior that\n","individuals cannot explain about themselves, commonly  known as intuition. If\n","someone doing a task is not conscious  of how they do it, they cannot give us an\n","algorithm to carry  out the task. The question becomes whether the unconscious\n","mind, though inaccessible to conscious thought, can be  accessed externally by\n","someone else. The practice of Western  psychology is based on the premise that\n","the answer is yes;  through careful, targeted questioning, psychologists learn\n","to  delve into what lies hidden in a client’s unconscious mind.  A skilled\n","questioner can extrapolate thoughts and feelings  that people are unaware of.17\n","What is particularly significant about machine learning   systems is that they\n","can use numerous cause–effect examples  to determine even unconscious\n","patterns—effectively reverse  engineering individuals’ behavior, at times better\n","than what  the individuals themselves could explain. Because people are  only\n","partially self-aware, they cannot reveal what they do  not consciously know. In\n","contrast, machines can thoroughly  observe and profile patterns of behavior that\n","people exhibit  unconsciously or unintentionally.   To summarize, there are\n","three kinds of situations in   which we cannot explicitly compile the rules for\n","a system’s  behavior from an authoritative source.   1. Natural systems in the\n","hard sciences such as physics,   chemistry and biology;  1235_ai.txt10\n","25-11-2020 14:56:45 Overview of AI Technologies • 11  2. Human-made systems\n","created by individuals that   are not available to explain or describe them, as\n","in   archeological sites and writings that have not been   decoded; and  3.\n","Unconscious behaviors, where people respond in   particular ways but cannot\n","explain how or why they   do so.  Machine learning seeks to analyze and\n","interpret these three  kinds of systems by studying numerous examples of cause\n","and effect to construct algorithms that replicate the system’s  behavior. The\n","more examples a machine has of a given  phenomenon, the better it can learn.\n","Machine learning is  inherently adaptive.  In some situations, a given\n","individual may be conscious   of how he or she does something but not know how\n","others  make decisions. For instance, a Covid-19 doctor might  not know how\n","thousands of other doctors worldwide are  treating patients. Machine learning\n","can also be used in these  cases—for example, to model the collective experience\n","of  medical clinicians scattered around the globe generating  millions of\n","patient outcomes. The lessons learned from  collective experience can be used to\n","improve the diagnosis,  management decisions, and therapies used.18 The AI\n","concept  known as swarm intelligence refers to the collective behavior  of\n","decentralized, self-organized systems. This concept holds  promise in studying\n","cultures as collective systems and serves  as a doorway for AI to enter into the\n","humanities and social  sciences.19  Humans and machines each have their own\n","competitive   advantages. Human intelligence spans multiple domains and\n","contexts. If machines had this ability it would be called  artificial general\n","intelligence. However, machine learning as  of now is highly context-specific\n","because it uses examples   1235_ai.txt11 25-11-2020 14:56:45 12 • Artificial\n","Intelligence and the Future of Power  from a specific environment. Consequently,\n","AI systems tend  to be applicable to only one kind of situation and have\n","difficulty sharing what they have learned across multiple  domains of knowledge.\n","Machines, on the other hand, are far superior in sharing   with each other the\n","models extracted from multiple machines  in the same area of expertise. For\n","instance, driverless cars  share examples of their performance and each decision\n","of  a given car is stored for the collective learning of all cars.  Human\n","drivers cannot share each other’s driving methods  in a similar way; no single\n","driver gets the benefit of every  other driver’s special experiences.\n","Furthermore, when human  drivers die, their knowledge is lost because the\n","technology to  transfer memory between humans does not exist. Knowledge\n","accumulated by one generation passes to the next only to  the extent that it has\n","been recorded in books, manuals or  transmitted personally and orally. In the\n","case of machines,  the demise of one does not lead to its memory loss. Even\n","after a machine stops functioning, its data remains available  for other\n","machines.  Thus, machines are better at sharing across different   members and\n","across lifespans, whereas humans are superior  at sharing across contextual\n","domains.  Traditional machine learning can function with relatively   small\n","amounts of data, but the performance of the algorithms  tends to plateau after a\n","certain amount of data has been  assimilated. The creation of neural\n","networks—processes  modeled after human brain activity—brought about a\n","fundamental breakthrough in machine learning.20 This enabled  the approach\n","called deep learning that involves training neural  networks on vast amounts of\n","data and building practical  applications. Deep learning algorithms keep\n","improving as  more data is fed into the system (see Figure 4).  1235_ai.txt12\n","25-11-2020 14:56:45 Overview of AI Technologies • 13   Figure 4: Relationship\n","Among Computer Science Disciplines  Big Data  Billions of individuals are being\n","minutely tracked from  cradle to grave and their profiles are curated with\n","private  information.

A major source is smart phones with their\n","range   of sensors.   •  The velocity at which data is captured is accelerating\n","because it is no longer constrained by the need for   manual entry. The Internet\n","of Things is a network of   millions of devices that transfers data between them\n","in real time.   •  Veracity refers to the quality of data, a measure of the\n","legitimacy and accuracy of this vast amount of data,   in contrast to fake news,\n","misinformation and viruses.  •  Value refers to data as a form of\n","capital—financial,   social and political.

To teach a driverless car, engineers\n","do not  program the car’s computer merely with a set of driving  rules. Instead,\n","the driverless cars teach themselves how to  drive just as humans do: through\n","experience and practice.  With dozens of onboard cameras and sensors feeding\n","data  into the system in real time, the cars learn to recognize  traffic\n","patterns and adjust their responses accordingly.  Each car’s AI system can\n","recognize shapes and   differentiate between pedestrians, bicyclists, cars,\n","trucks  and tractor-trailers. It builds a real-time detailed map of  its\n","immediate physical environment, identifying each object  nearby. By applying\n","what it has previously learned, it can  predict not only the speed of each type\n","of object but also  how it might suddenly change direction. Equipped with this\n","predictive model of everything in its vicinity, the system can  compute every\n","possible scenario for the next second, the next  two seconds, the next three\n","seconds, and so on. Hence, it  can choose options to minimize the chances of a\n","collision.  Further, the collective practice of all driverless cars, as   an\n","example, is far more extensive than the total lifetime  experience of even the\n","most sophisticated individual human  driver. The reason is that the skill of\n","human drivers  remains in their isolated memories, encoded as individual\n","reflexes and habits, and passes on with the drivers. But the  proficiency of\n","each driverless car is systematically analyzed  and shared with other cars.\n","Eventually, as driverless vehicles  are interconnected via 5G, they will\n","directly communicate  with each other, allowing vehicles to collectively\n","negotiate  decisions to optimize the flow of traffic.  Once machines are trained\n","to perform tasks, they are   often able to do them better than humans.

Machines  are not restricted by the limitations of human memory or\n","lifespan. Their clock speed and memory can be continually  increased. Their\n","behavior is more consistent and predictable  than that of humans. They possess\n","more stamina and can  operate under conditions that are unsafe or unsustainable\n","for humans.  The potential of machines to improve does not mean they   are\n","progressing toward some perfect outcome. Computers are  still susceptible to\n","subtle influences and omissions. Ideological  biases do sneak into machine\n","learning applications, whether  consciously or unconsciously. One example of\n","bias was  exposed by a report in the journal Science about an algorithm  used by\n","US insurance companies and hospitals to identify  patients requiring high-risk\n","care. The algorithm contained  an unconscious bias against Blacks because it\n","used historical  healthcare spending patterns—which varies between Blacks  and\n","Whites—to determine patients’ current needs. The US  Senate demanded a review of\n","this practice, temporarily  undermining the public’s trust in AI.23  The use of\n","AI to screen job applicants has also been called   into question. If machines’\n","training is based on data that is  not balanced, bias may occur at various\n","points in the process  and routinely eliminate qualified applicants that do not\n","fit  precisely into the categories developed by the machine learning  system. At\n","Amazon, a machine learning model demonstrated  a gender bias against the resumes\n","of female candidates based  on the historical preponderance of male\n","candidates.24  Bias also crept into Microsoft’s attempt to build a bot   that\n","could interact on Twitter. TayTweets was inadvertently  trained on a vast amount\n","of mostly biased tweets in a twenty four-hour period, and as a result when\n","TayTweets interacted   1235_ai.txt17 25-11-2020 14:56:46 18 • Artificial\n","Intelligence and the Future of Power  on Twitter, its responses were downright\n","racist! Microsoft  had to backtrack and quickly took down its bot.25  Evolution\n","of AI Devices26  In the decade spanning 2005 through 2015, the growth of\n","smartphones positioned them for large-scale data collection.  These devices,\n","equipped with ever more advanced sensors,  wireless networking, imaging, and\n","voice capabilities, have  been capturing much larger quantities of data than\n","desktop  or laptop counterparts. Social media companies grabbed this\n","opportunity and became dominant platforms supplying a  variety of services. Many\n","mobile-friendly technologies and  applications emerged in this decade and\n","continue to be  important sources of big data.  Then the wearables space took\n","off in a big way with   the pioneering Fitbit and Pebble smartwatch. Several\n","fitness tracking watches quickly emerged, with their functions  eventually\n","absorbed into smartwatches such as the Apple  Watch. The development of these\n","devices established a new  kind of data to mine at scale: personal health and\n","fitness. In  the medical industry, such data often captures the most intimate\n","details of a person’s physical performance and is considered  extremely\n","confidential. Through the social gamification of  fitness and health, as well as\n","other subterfuges, technology  companies have acquired medical datasets that may\n","well  rival that of some large healthcare organizations. However,  because they\n","are classified as nonmedical companies, it is  unclear whether they will be held\n","to the same standards of  data protection as the medical industry.27  With\n","smartphones and wearables proving the value of   mining private data, the next\n","step pushed the boundaries  even further by positioning data gathering under the\n","guise of  safety and convenience. In 2014, Amazon’s Alexa successfully\n","1235_ai.txt18 25-11-2020 14:56:46 Overview of AI Technologies • 19  overcame the\n","first barrier to household penetration of  smart home technologies, putting its\n","always-on ambient  conversational AI at users’ beck and call to perform simple\n","tasks around the house. Amazon, Google and Apple have  made huge investments in\n","home automation technologies  and partnerships with appliance manufacturers to\n","capture  a plethora of data from households, including voice, video,\n","temperature, soil humidity, air purity, Wi-Fi strength, how  often someone opens\n","the refrigerator, eating habits, and every  other imaginable parameter\n","measurable by a gadget that’s  connected to the AI hub at home.  These voice\n","interfaces will soon be embedded into   ambient surfaces like ceilings and walls\n","and furniture instead  of being standalone devices. Amazon has tied up with a\n","prefab construction company to pursue this.28 Users will  not even have to think\n","about whether they are in the same  room as a smart device—the interface will be\n","omnipresent.  Smart home products with voice-activated assistants,   light\n","bulbs, appliances, entertainment systems, and security  systems are now powered\n","by AI. Video face recognition,  speech recognition, and Natural Language\n","Processing (NLP) for understanding personal conversations is taking the\n","surveillance monitoring of private lives deeper than ever  before.  Data privacy\n","issues have not been adequately addressed   vis-à-vis transparency on where and\n","how all this data is  stored and handled, who has access to it, and the\n","relationship  between the manufacturer and local law enforcement to  govern its\n","usage.  From wearables, the industry is progressing to implants   that\n","physically fuse technology into our bodies and tinker with  the creation of a\n","new kind of augmented human being.

They would serve as a token of our physical  identity and encode\n","crucial information about us. It is also  plausible that implantation of\n","technologies may become the  norm for applications like communication, health\n","monitoring  and physical identification. The data harvested from such  devices\n","would model personal consumer behavior and be  extraordinarily invasive and\n","intrusive in terms of privacy.   Each of the modalities mentioned above has\n","broken new   ground in creating a new kind of data about individuals that  was\n","hitherto unavailable or difficult to obtain—variety, one  of the 5 Vs. The more\n","kinds of data that corporations can  mine, the more complete the psychological\n","and behavioral  profiles of individuals that can be built; hence, the more\n","sophisticated the ability of corporations to manipulate  individuals and entire\n","societies, by providing subtle nudges  and cues through their every interaction\n","with technology.   While each modality enables a greater variety of data to   be\n","collected, the veracity of the data also benefits. Rather than  depending on\n","humans to voluntarily provide information,  the devices are an always-on ambient\n","surveillance mechanism  continuously gathering data.

INTELLIGENCE VERSUS\n","CONSCIOUSNESS  Science fiction that depicts AI in the form of conscious  beings\n","has fueled popular misconceptions of AI and done  a disservice by trivializing\n","the imminent AI revolution.  Fantastic narratives have generated lively\n","speculation and  debate regarding the consciousness of machines.  People often\n","confuse intelligence and consciousness.   Intelligence exists in many forms and\n","can be conscious  1235_ai.txt23 25-11-2020 14:56:46  24 • Artificial\n","Intelligence and the Future of Power  or unconscious. Human intelligence is only\n","one kind of  intelligence.   Artificial Intelligence and Artificial\n","Consciousness (AC)   are vastly different. Machine intelligence simply refers to\n","machines’ ability to function in practical ways equivalent to humans.\n","Consciousness is neither necessary nor sufficient  for a system to be\n","intelligent. An intelligent system could  be unconscious. Conversely, a\n","conscious system could be  unintelligent.  When a truck driver loses work to a\n","driverless vehicle, it   does not matter whether the vehicle is conscious or\n","not. What  matters is that machines can replace human workers by doing  the same\n","job and performing it better and/or at a lower cost.  We recognize that horses\n","are conscious while automobiles are  not, but this distinction did not prevent\n","automobiles from  performing the work previously done by horses. In the same\n","way, the advent of driverless cars and trucks will eventually  make today’s\n","automobile industry obsolete.  Similarly, when computers analyze X-rays and\n","other   medical diagnostics more efficiently and accurately than  human experts,\n","the implications for the healthcare field have  nothing to do with whether the\n","machines are conscious.   To differentiate between Artificial Intelligence and\n","Artificial   Consciousness, the linguistic framework of classifying  statements\n","as first, second and third person is useful.  •  In first-person statements, I\n","discuss something about   myself, such as my feelings or something going   on\n","inside me. The first-person voice expresses the   speaker’s selfhood, or the\n","“I”. “I am happy” and “I   am at home” are examples of first-person statements.\n","This ability to experience oneself is known as sentience.  •  Second-person\n","statements are those made to another   person or persons, for instance, “You are\n","early”.   1235_ai.txt24 25-11-2020 14:56:46 Overview of AI Technologies • 25\n","Second-person speech is interpersonal and tends to   be direct with one or more\n","persons that are present.   •  Third-person statements are used to refer to an\n","object   or entity: he, she, it, or they. The entity referenced   may be another\n","person, an inanimate object, or an   abstract idea, such as “It is hot today”.\n","Speech about  something or someone is a third-person statement.   Humans possess\n","all three qualities: the first-person is our  selfhood; the second-person\n","consists of our interpersonal  relations; and the third-person is the realm of\n","mental objects  such as cognition and concepts.   The term philosophical zombie\n","(or p-zombie) has been   used to refer to an entity that exhibits second- and\n","third person capabilities but lacks first-person awareness. As  individuals we\n","know that we are not a p-zombie but have  no way of ascertaining whether someone\n","else is a p-zombie  or not. Humans have no window to see another person’s  inner\n","being. We cannot determine whether another person  is self-aware or merely a\n","robot pretending to be human.  No matter how much someone externally appears to\n","have   an inner sense of self, no test exists that can definitively rule  out\n","the possibility that they are a machine simply pretending  to have a self.\n","P-zombies are indistinguishable from any  normal human being. If a p-zombie were\n","poked with a sharp  object it would not experience any pain, yet outwardly it\n","would behave exactly as if it had. From a purely practical  perspective, an\n","entity’s ability—or lack of ability—to function  from the first-person\n","perspective is irrelevant to others.  Human intelligence is partly conscious and\n","partly   unconscious. For instance, I am not conscious of several  biological\n","mechanisms within my own body, such as my  cardiac functions and my digestion,\n","which are functioning all  the time. While these functions are extraordinarily\n","complex   1235_ai.txt25 25-11-2020 14:56:46 26 • Artificial Intelligence and the\n","Future of Power  and intelligent, we are not conscious of them, and more\n","importantly these processes are not themselves self-conscious.  Similarly, we\n","are also unconscious of large portions of our  mind, where intelligent processes\n","go on all the time without  self-awareness.30  Our body grows, adapts, heals\n","itself, and deals with   unexpected threats and attacks from external forces\n","through  unconscious intelligence, i.e., by learning from experience  and\n","feedback the same way machine learning does.   Clearly, intelligent learning\n","does not require consciousness—   neither in the case of our body nor of a\n","machine.   Artificial Intelligence’s third-person capability allows it   to run\n","complex algorithms about all sorts of entities, and  to become better at solving\n","problems defined in terms of  objects and ideas. Machines’ second-person\n","capability gives  them the uncanny ability to interact with humans just as\n","other humans would. However, an AI system does not need  to experience first-\n","person self-awareness to do its job.   The question of a machine’s selfhood is\n","inconsequential   to the practical benefits and challenges that AI presents.\n","Considerations of selfhood belong, instead, to the field  of Artificial\n","Consciousness. Many thinkers that fail to  comprehend the multilayered and\n","practical impacts of AI  are focused on tangential philosophical questions more\n","appropriate to Artificial Consciousness. They present  arguments about machines\n","lacking sentience, but such  arguments are irrelevant to the impact of AI.\n","Experts on the nature of intelligence like to debate between   the top-down and\n","bottom-up models of the emergence of  natural intelligence.

The following pages\n","give a brief  survey to illustrate sone of the applications.  Healthcare\n","Healthcare is one of the most important domains in which AI  technology is\n","bringing positive effects. This is not surprising  since medical practice is\n","based on protocols and a protocol  is basically an algorithm. Algorithms help\n","medical doctors  diagnose conditions efficiently and effectively; experts who\n","compare the quality of human versus machine diagnoses find  machines to be\n","gaining an advantage in many specialized  areas.   In times of crisis like the\n","Covid-19 pandemic, when   medical emergencies overwhelm the capacities of even\n","the  best of public health systems, AI is used for rapid diagnosis  with less\n","reliance on human involvement than ever before  and with superior diagnostic\n","accuracy. For instance, in San  Diego, health radiologists and other physicians\n","are using  AI to analyze lung imaging to rapidly detect Covid-19.31  The\n","outcomes of every diagnosis and patient consultation   at major institutions are\n","being channeled into a central  diagnostic database for machine learning. As a\n","result,  machines are accumulating more medical knowledge and  clinical\n","experience than human doctors ever could, and AI  will gradually replace, or at\n","minimum supplement, doctors in  making diagnoses, except for highly specialized\n","situations.32  Machine learning techniques are already being used in   studying\n","the effects of different medical interventions such as  1235_ai.txt28 25-11-2020\n","14:56:46  Overview of AI Technologies • 29  lockdowns.33 Technology helps\n","monitor disease progression,  track and control logistics and supply chains in\n","real time,  monitor public health to pinpoint infection hotspots, identify  and\n","classify infected individuals to help optimize public  health systems, and\n","coordinate responses.   The pandemic has forced physicians and their patients\n","to use telemedicine, and the response has been universally  favorable. Machine\n","learning is augmenting doctors and at  the same time telemedicine can capture\n","new kinds of patient  data such as facial expressions, emotional states, etc.\n","The  pandemic is also accelerating the commercial availability of  health and\n","fitness wearables to facilitate doctor-supervised  health monitoring, remote\n","diagnostics, and even certain  treatments. With new kinds of devices there will\n","be new  kinds of data captured as well.  The field of AI in epidemiology\n","specializes in building   models to predict how diseases spread. In cases where\n","the data set is far larger than usual, AI epidemiological  models are better\n","than conventional models for tracking  and predicting the spread of diseases.\n","For instance, a start  up in Malaysia developed an AI model to predict which\n","neighborhoods are likely to have a dengue fever outbreak.34 The Canadian company\n","BlueDot developed an AI system  to accurately predict when Covid-19 would\n","migrate from  Wuhan to Bangkok, Seoul, Taipei and Tokyo, based on  analysis of\n","airline ticket data and the locations of travelers’  mobile phones.35 Artificial\n","Intelligence is now harnessing  medical big data on individuals in order to\n","model the  spread of the pandemic and to manage real-time public  health\n","policies. Public health systems around the world are  analyzing big data on\n","human responses to the virus and to  government policies, as well the\n","effectiveness of different  kinds of treatments.   1235_ai.txt29 25-11-2020\n","14:56:47 30 • Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power  Artificial\n","Intelligence, in combination with mobile robots,   will provide a much-needed\n","support ecosystem for the care  of the elderly. As the aging population\n","increases worldwide,  their care will have to be entrusted to robotic nurses,\n","doctors  and other helpers because the cost of human caregivers will  become\n","prohibitive.  Another area witnessing huge breakthroughs is research   on the\n","human genome. The study of how genes behave  and influence physiological\n","functioning is an exciting new  frontier. Human DNA contains more than 20,000\n","individual  genes. Because of its inherent complexity, gene analysis  requires\n","the help of AI. The benefits of this research range  from improving\n","understanding of diseases and developing  more effective treatments to\n","furthering doctors’ ability to  predict patients’ future health. However, a\n","downside is that  the same AI technology developed for cures can also be\n","applied to create intelligent germ warfare.36  Another pioneering example is the\n","Fortune 500 American   multinational, and one of the world’s leading healthcare\n","companies, Johnson & Johnson’s project known as Mellody,  which stands for\n","“Machine Learning Ledger Orchestration for  Drug Discovery”, whose purpose is to\n","leverage “the world’s  largest collection of small molecules with known\n","biochemical  or cellular activity to enable more accurate predictive models  and\n","increase efficiencies in drug discovery”.37  Neural networks can be trained to\n","model and replicate the   behavior of pathogens and biological systems that\n","constantly  learn. Once Covid-19 is modeled as an algorithm (regardless  of how\n","complex it is), treatments can be developed as  counter-algorithms that\n","neutralize the mechanisms of the  disease. Such advancements can then be applied\n","to fight  many other diseases.   In a different kind of application of AI, the\n","Pentagon,   1235_ai.txt30 25-11-2020 14:56:47 Overview of AI Technologies • 31\n","the headquarters of the US’ Department of Defense, has  developed a system that\n","uses infrared lasers to identify  individuals by reading their heartbeat from as\n","far as two  hundred yards away.

While most  current commercial technologies of this kind require\n","users to  wear a physical device, remote sensing technologies of the  future\n","will be able to read detailed personal data without  the awareness or permission\n","of individuals.  Biotechnology and information technology are   already\n","combining to create a new era of body and mind  management. Applications such as\n","medical implants that can  intervene in mental functions will increasingly\n","manage (and  perhaps manipulate) human emotions and psychology.

For instance, the US government has  granted a\n","permit to a treatment for Attention Deficit Disorder  (ADD) using a digital\n","game.39 Some of the laudable goals  of such technology would be to prevent or\n","treat serious  mental health problems and even avert criminal behavior.  In the\n","long run there will be technologically enhanced   humans that will exhibit all\n","sorts of novel qualities, both  physical and mental.

To help build driverless vehicles for  the\n","US military, DARPA organized a competition with a  million-dollar prize for\n","building a self-driving car that would  drive the fastest through the Mojave\n","Desert, a distance of  142 miles. In the first challenge in 2004, every car\n","crashed,  failed, or caught fire in the early phase of the race. But  the event\n","galvanized the imagination of young technocrats,  and a research ecosystem\n","emerged with the commitment to  build practical driverless cars. In the 2005\n","race, there were  five finishers, and this took the AI and robotics world by\n","storm. Many of the contenders in DARPA races went on  to play leading roles in\n","what is now the driverless vehicles  industry.40  Advances in this field will\n","virtually eliminate the need for   human drivers, just as a century ago\n","automobiles eliminated  the need for horses.

Some even  argued\n","that important characteristics of the horse—such as  its instincts, feelings and\n","sensibilities—could not be replaced  by an unfeeling machine.  Similar arguments\n","against driverless cars are rampant   today. Despite a lack of emotions and so-\n","called common  sense in cars, the pragmatic reality is that mainstream  adoption\n","of driverless vehicles will result in millions of drivers  worldwide—long-haul\n","truckers, delivery drivers, taxi and  personal drivers—losing their ability to\n","earn a living.

Agriculture  Much of the technology\n","developed for driverless cars has  been deployed on farm equipment as well. The\n","American  corporation John Deere, already has autonomous tractors  that can\n","operate long days, under adverse conditions, and  even in coordination with\n","other unmanned and manned  equipment on farms. Caterpillar is another heavy-\n","equipment  manufacturer that has integrated AI-based autonomy into  its fleet.\n","Artificial Intelligence will also bring about smart   agriculture that enables\n","plants to survive climate change:  for instance, dramatically reducing the\n","amount of water  required to grow certain crops.

Artificial Intelligence can be effective in conjunction with   what\n","is called a digital twin, which is a virtual replica of  a complete physical\n","environment such as a farm that is  recreated using data collected from a\n","variety of sensors.  In effect, the twin is the video-game equivalent of a real\n","world farm. Farmers can simulate conditions in the virtual  landscape just like\n","someone playing a video game—changing  environmental conditions, choice of\n","seeds, pests encountered,  and other factors.

The United Kingdom’s Brimstone\n","missile system and  Israel’s Harpy Air Defense Suppression System are almost\n","autonomous. South Korea deploys a sentry robot with an  automatic mode called\n","SGR-A1 on the North Korean front.

The term unsupervised learning refers to machine learning  in which\n","the system is turned loose to explore and discover  structures on its own. It\n","can be effective in building entirely  new models of society. The quality and\n","quantity of big data  being generated by the digital platforms in a single day\n","far  exceeds all the data gathered by social scientists over the past  two\n","hundred years. However, the mere fact that the machine  learning is unsupervised\n","does not mean it is free from biases.  1235_ai.txt39 25-11-2020 14:56:47 40 •\n","Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power  The fact is that any AI-based\n","discovery of social structures   would depend on the goals and values of the\n","developers.  These values serve as the guiding principles to implement  the deep\n","mining of knowledge about society and discover  its structures. Such principles\n","are bound to be conditioned  by the developers’ worldview.   For instance, each\n","time Facebook flags a post for   “violating social norms”, its algorithm is\n","premised on a  subjective principle of what these social norms ought to be.\n","Imagine the algorithms making such decisions were based  on the ethical\n","principle that animals are spiritual beings like  humans and deserve respect.\n","Such an algorithm would reject  many posts that promote animal products, animal\n","laboratory  testing, and so forth. Or, if the criteria were controlled by  a\n","radical Islamic republic that considers women exposing  their faces a criminal\n","act. Contrast that with a principle  that considers the burqa a violation of\n","human rights. The  list of such subjective social norms is endless.   Even in\n","the same country values change drastically   over time. Had there been AI-based\n","algorithms enforcing  community standards in the US a century ago, Presidents\n","Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson would have been  heroes and posts praising\n","them given high rankings. But  today the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in\n","the US is  fighting against what it considers white supremacy and has  disgraced\n","these iconic presidents; praising them can violate  present-day community\n","standards. Likewise, Christopher  Columbus, for whom there is a US federal\n","holiday, is now  branded racist and many organizations boycott his birthday.\n","Bias also creeps into AI models by the pre-selection of the  data used for\n","training the model as well as from the choice of  model to be used. There is no\n","universal or consistent set of  principles that Facebook, Twitter, Google, and\n","others could   1235_ai.txt40 25-11-2020 14:56:47 Overview of AI Technologies •\n","41  claim to be implementing in their algorithms to prioritize  the social merit\n","or demerit of content.

The intention is to  make entertaining computerized games\n","where players can  compete against themselves, or the machine, or each other.\n","This is done by taking advantage of their psychological  predispositions. The\n","cognitive science and neuroscience of  human motivation and response to\n","pleasure/pain has been  used by game developers over the past few decades to\n","perfect  their ability to maximize players’ engagement.   In parallel, a field\n","emerged that adds game mechanisms and   psychology of competitiveness into\n","nongame environments  such as consumer marketing. By tracking each individual\n","consumer’s interactions using a scorecard, the marketers  stimulate the\n","consumer’s behavior to reinforce positive  responses and increase participation.\n","Typically, the marketer  starts a gamification project by defining its\n","objectives in  measurable terms, and the target audience’s motivations are\n","researched.51 In principle, one can gamify any set of rules,  principles, or\n","values as the criteria that define victory and  defeat.  For this book, I am\n","adapting the concept of gamification   beyond its normal usage and applying it\n","to describe  interventions in politics and social engineering. Such\n","applications already exist even though the term gamification  might not be in\n","formal use to describe them. I find it a  useful framework to understand the\n","application of AI to  manipulate social behavior.52 Once these cultural and\n","social  activities are looked through the lens of gamification, many  more ideas\n","emerge—such as the possibility of gamifying the  grand narrative of a nation or\n","civilization.  1235_ai.txt42 25-11-2020 14:56:47 Overview of AI Technologies •\n","43  The principle of gamification to reward good habits could   be applied to\n","optimize good dharmic behavior (i.e. karma  gamification), good environmental\n","behavior, good behavior  in advocating and practicing human diversity, and so\n","forth.  The list is as long as the list of social causes.  Figure 7 shows how\n","one could start with a social theory,   use it as the foundation to build\n","policies and principles for  social, economic and political systems, and then\n","develop  concrete rules for measuring behavior, and finally gamifying it  to\n","modify social behavior. One can gamify any grand narrative  and expand it in\n","powerful ways without necessarily using  hard power over the citizens.

With   this reorientation from knowledge to power, it is no   longer\n","enough to automate information flows about  us; the goal is to automate us.54\n","Zuboff has popularized the term “Instrumentarian society”  to describe the\n","emerging society in which individuals are  herded as machines operating\n","collectively under the control  of algorithms:  Just as industrial society was\n","imagined as a well  functioning machine, Instrumentarian society is imagined\n","as a human simulation of machine learning systems: a   confluent hive mind in\n","which each element learns and   operates in concert with every other element. In\n","the   model of machine confluence, the “freedom” of each   individual machine is\n","subordinated to the knowledge   of the system as a whole.

A civilization’s grand narrative can be used explicitly or\n","implicitly to define the goals and objectives of an AI system.
